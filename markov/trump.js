var input = `You know, the military and the law enforcement, generally speaking, but all of it but the military gave us tremendous percentages of votes. We were unbelievably successful in the election with getting the vote of the military. And probably almost everybody in this room voted for me, but I will not ask you to raise your hands if you did. But I would guarantee a big portion, because we're all on the same wavelength, folks. We're all on the same wavelength, right? He knows. It took Brian about 30 seconds to figure that one out, right, because we know we're on the same wavelength. But we're going to do great things. We're going to do great things. We've been fighting these wars for longer than any wars we've ever fought. We have not used the real abilities that we have. We've been restrained. We have to get rid of ISIS. Have to get rid of ISIS. We have no choice. Radical Islamic terrorism. And I said it yesterday it has to be eradicated just off the face of the Earth. This is evil. This is evil. And you know, I can understand the other side. We can all understand the other side. There can be wars between countries, there can be wars. You can understand what happened. This is something nobody can even understand. This is a level of evil that we haven't seen. And you're going to go to it, and you're going to do a phenomenal job. But we're going to end it. It's time. It's time right now to end it. You have somebody coming on who is extraordinary. For the different positions of Secretary of This and Secretary of That and all of these great positions, I'd see five, six, seven, eight people. And we had a great transition. We had an amazing team of talent. And, by the way, General Flynn is right over here. Put up your hand. What a good guy. And Reince and my whole group. Reince you know they don't care about Reince. He's like this political guy that turned out to be a superstar, right? We don't have to talk about Reince. But we did we had such a tremendous, tremendous success. So when I'm interviewing all of these candidates that Reince and his whole group is putting in front, it went very, very quickly, and, in this case, went so quickly because I would see six or seven or eight for Secretary of Agriculture, who we just named the other day, Sonny Perdue, former governor of Georgia. Fantastic guy. But I'd see six, seven, eight people for a certain position. Everybody wanted it. But I met Mike Pompeo, and it was the only guy I met. I didn't want to meet anybody else. I said, cancel everybody else. Cancel. Now, he was approved, essentially, but they're doing little political games with me. He was one of the three. Now, last night, as you know, General Mattis, fantastic guy, and General Kelly got approved. And Mike Pompeo was supposed to be in that group. It was going to be the three of them. Can you imagine all of these guys? People respect you know, they respect that military sense. All my political people, they're not doing so well. The political people aren't doing so well but you. We're going to get them all through, but some will take a little bit longer than others. But Mike was literally I had a group of what, we had nine different people? Now, I must say, I didn't mind cancelling eight appointments. That wasn't the worst thing in the world. But I met him and I said, he is so good. Number one in his class at West Point. Now, I know a lot about West Point. I'm a person that very strongly believes in academics. In fact, every time I say I had an uncle who was a great professor at MIT for 35 years who did a fantastic job in so many different ways, academically was an academic genius and then they say, is Donald Trump an intellectual? Trust me, I'm like a smart persona. And I recognized immediately. So he was number one at West Point, and he was also essentially number one at Harvard Law School. And then he decided to go into the military. And he ran for Congress. And everything he's done has been a home run. People like him, but much more importantly to me, everybody respects him. And when I told Paul Ryan that I wanted to do this, I would say he may be the only person that was not totally thrilled right, Mike? Because he said, I don't want to lose this guy. But you will be getting a total star. You're going to be getting a total gem. He's a gem. You'll see. You'll see. And many of you know him anyway. But you're going to see. And again, we have some great people going in. But this one is something is going to be very special, because this is one, if I had to name the most important, this would certainly be perhaps you know, in certain ways, you could say my most important. You do the job like everybody in this room is capable of doing. And the generals are wonderful, and the fighting is wonderful. But if you give them the right direction, boy, does the fighting become easier. And, boy, do we lose so fewer lives, and win so quickly. And that's what we have to do. We have to start winning again. You know, when I was young and when I was of course, I feel young. I feel like I'm 30, 35, 39. Somebody said, are you young? I said, I think I'm young. You know, I was stopping when we were in the final month of that campaign, four stops, five stops, seven stops. Speeches, speeches, in front of 25,000, 30,000 people, 15,000, 19,000 from stop to stop. I feel young. When I was young and I think we're all sort of young. When I was young, we were always winning things in this country. We'd win with trade. We'd win with wars. At a certain age, I remember hearing from one of my instructors, The United States has never lost a war. And then, after that, it's like we haven't won anything. We don't win anymore. The old expression, to the victor belong the spoils you remember. I always used to say, keep the oil. I wasn't a fan of Iraq. I didn't want to go into Iraq. But I will tell you, when we were in, we got out wrong. And I always said, in addition to that, keep the oil. Now, I said it for economic reasons. But if you think about it, Mike, if we kept the oil you probably wouldn't have ISIS because that's where they made their money in the first place. So we should have kept the oil. But okay. Maybe you'll have another chance. But the fact is, should have kept the oil. I believe that this group is going to be one of the most important groups in this country toward making us safe, toward making us winners again, toward ending all of the problems. We have so many problems that are interrelated that we don't even think of, but interrelated to the kind of havoc and fear that this sick group of people has caused. So I can only say that I am with you 1,000 percent. And the reason you're my first stop is that, as you know, I have a running war with the media. They are among the most dishonest human beings on Earth. And they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community. And I just want to let you know, the reason you're the number-one stop is exactly the opposite exactly. And they understand that, too. And I was explaining about the numbers. We did a thing yesterday at the speech. Did everybody like the speech? I've been given good reviews. But we had a massive field of people. You saw them. Packed. I get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks, and they show an empty field. I say, wait a minute, I made a speech. I looked out, the field was it looked like a million, million and a half people. They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there. And they said, Donald Trump did not draw well. I said, it was almost raining, the rain should have scared them away, but God looked down and he said, we're not going to let it rain on your speech. In fact, when I first started, I said, oh, no. The first line, I got hit by a couple of drops. And I said, oh, this is too bad, but we'll go right through it. But the truth is that it stopped immediately. It was amazing. And then it became really sunny. And then I walked off and it poured right after I left. It poured. But, you know, we have something that's amazing because we had it looked honestly, it looked like a million and a half people. Whatever it was, it was. But it went all the way back to the Washington Monument. And I turn on and by mistake I get this network, and it showed an empty field. And it said we drew 250,000 people. Now, that's not bad, but it's a lie. We had 250,000 people literally around you know, in the little bowl that we constructed. That was 250,000 people. The rest of the 20-block area, all the way back to the Washington Monument, was packed. So we caught them, and we caught them in a beauty. And I think they're going to pay a big price. We had another one yesterday, which was interesting. In the Oval Office there's a beautiful statue of Dr&period; Martin Luther King. And I also happen to like Churchill, Winston Churchill. I think most of us like Churchill. He doesn't come from our country, but had a lot to do with it. Helped us; real ally. And, as you know, the Churchill statue was taken out the bust. And as you also probably have read, the Prime Minister is coming over to our country very shortly. And they wanted to know whether or not I'd like it back. I say, absolutely, but in the meantime we have a bust of Churchill. So a reporter for Time magazine and I have been on there cover, like, 14 or 15 times. I think we have the all-time record in the history of Time Magazine. Like, if Tom Brady is on the cover, it's one time, because he won the Super Bowl or something, right? I've been on it for 15 times this year. I don't think that's a record, Mike, that can ever be broken. Do you agree with that? What do you think? But I will say that they said it was very interesting that Donald Trump took down the bust, the statue, of Dr&period; Martin Luther King. And it was right there. But there was a cameraman that was in front of it. So Zeke from Time Magazine writes a story about I took down. I would never do that because I have great respect for Dr&period; Martin Luther King. But this is how dishonest the media is. Now, the big story the retraction was, like, where? Was it a line? Or do they even bother putting it in? So I only like to say that because I love honesty. I like honest reporting. I will tell you, final time although I will say it, when you let in your thousands of other people that have been trying to come in because I am coming back we're going to have to get you a larger room. I would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila. We're closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time. But it is really very sad as to what's going on throughout the world with terror. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected. Before we discuss the Paris Accord, I'd like to begin with an update on our tremendous absolutely tremendous economic progress since Election Day on November 8th. The economy is starting to come back, and very, very rapidly. We've added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a million private sector jobs. I have just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly $350 billion of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. It was a very, very successful trip, believe me. Thank you. Thank you. In my meetings at the G7, we have taken historic steps to demand fair and reciprocal trade that gives Americans a level playing field against other nations. We're also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up and you see that, you see it all over from the previous administration, including getting many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror. Big, big contributions are being made by countries that weren't doing so much in the form of contribution. One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American people during my campaign for President whether it's cutting job-killing regulations; appointing and confirming a tremendous Supreme Court justice; putting in place tough new ethics rules; achieving a record reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border; or bringing jobs, plants, and factories back into the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible. And believe me, we've just begun. The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly even more so. On these issues and so many more, we're following through on our commitments. And I don't want anything to get in our way. I am fighting every day for the great people of this country. Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord thank you, thank you but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris Accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. So we're getting out. But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that's fair. And if we can, that's great. And if we can't, that's fine. As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of American citizens. The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers who I love and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production. Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country. This includes ending the implementation of the nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States a vast fortune. Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates. This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs not what we need believe me, this is not what we need including automobile jobs, and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely. They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little. According to this same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors: paper down 12 percent; cement down 23 percent; iron and steel down 38 percent; coal and I happen to love the coal miners down 86 percent; natural gas down 31 percent. The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that. Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals. As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States which is what it does the world's leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world's leading polluters. For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years 13. They can do whatever they want for 13 years. Not us. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. There are many other examples. But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States. Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America which it does, and the mines are starting to open up. We're having a big opening in two weeks. Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places. A big opening of a brand-new mine. It's unheard of. For many, many years, that hasn't happened. They asked me if I'd go. I'm going to try. China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So we can't build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020. Think of it: India can double their coal production. We're supposed to get rid of ours. Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants. In short, the agreement doesn't eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries. This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States. The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement they went wild; they were so happy for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage. A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world. We have among the most abundant energy reserves on the planet, sufficient to lift millions of America's poorest workers out of poverty. Yet, under this agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking away the great wealth of our nation it's great wealth, it's phenomenal wealth; not so long ago, we had no idea we had such wealth and leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness. The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries. At 1 percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand, but at 3 or 4 percent growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life. Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree think of that; this much Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100. Tiny, tiny amount. In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America and this is an incredible statistic would totally wipe out the gains from America's expected reductions in the year 2030, after we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs, closed factories, and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and for our homes. As the Wall Street Journal wrote this morning: The reality is that withdrawing is in America's economic interest and won't matter much to the climate. The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. We'll be the cleanest. We're going to have the cleanest air. We're going to have the cleanest water. We will be environmentally friendly, but we're not going to put our businesses out of work and we're not going to lose our jobs. We're going to grow; we're going to grow rapidly. And I think you just read it just came out minutes ago, the small business report small businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people. One of the best reports they've seen in many years. I'm willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris, under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers. So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let's make them non-obstructionists. We will all sit down, and we will get back into the deal. And we'll make it good, and we won't be closing up our factories, and we won't be losing our jobs. And we'll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord or something that we can do that's much better than the Paris Accord. And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled. But until we do that, we're out of the agreement. I will work to ensure that America remains the world's leader on environmental issues, but under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world. No responsible leader can put the workers and the people of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, while empowering some of the world's top polluting countries, should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wish to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement: It's to give their country an economic edge over the United States. That's not going to happen while I'm President. I'm sorry. My job as President is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on Earth, and with the highest standard of living and the highest standard of environmental protection. Our tax bill is moving along in Congress, and I believe it's doing very well. I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised. The Republicans are working very, very hard. We'd love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone. But it's going very well. The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country's expense. They don't put America first. I do, and I always will. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance. You see what's happening. It's pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind. At what point does America get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at us as a country? We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers. We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore. And they won't be. They won't be. I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America's interests. Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation. Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but they'll soon be under renegotiation. The process has begun from day one. But now we're down to business. Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund nice name which calls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing countries all on top of America's existing and massive foreign aid payments. So we're going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we're already way ahead of anybody else. Many of the other countries haven't spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime. The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion nobody else is even close; most of them haven't even paid anything including funds raided out of America's budget for the war against terrorism. That's where they came. Believe me, they didn't come from me. They came just before I came into office. Not good. And not good the way they took the money. In 2015, the United Nation's departing top climate officials reportedly described the $100 billion per year as peanuts, and stated that the $100 billion is the tail that wags the dog. In 2015, the Green Climate Fund's executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450 billion per year after 2020. And nobody even knows where the money is going to. Nobody has been able to say, where is it going to? Of course, the world's top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. America is $20 trillion in debt. Cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers or fix vital infrastructure. Millions of our citizens are out of work. And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. So think of that. There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well. Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the U.S. economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives. Thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America's sovereignty. Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. And I will. Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on America's abundant energy reserves, which we have started very strongly. It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better deal. The risks grow as historically these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time. In other words, the Paris framework is a starting point as bad as it is not an end point. And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States' sovereignty and massive future legal liability. Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people. The Paris Accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risks, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world. It is time to exit the Paris Accord and time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country. It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania along with many, many other locations within our great country before Paris, France. It is time to make America great again. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. We're at $700 billion, and by the way, going up. We make the best military equipment in the world. A shot was just taken by Iran, at my opinion, at Saudi Arabia. You know about that, right? You saw the missile that went out? And our system knocked the missile out of the air. That's how good we are. Nobody makes what we make, and now we're selling it all over the world. It is grueling, they tell me. But fortunately, historically that has not been a problem for me. I mean one thing you people will say that has not been a problem. We had a choice. I could have done it I could have done a five, and a four. Or I could have done two fives. Or I could have done one 12. I think we're going to have a great success. I mean, look, I've had a very successful presidency. You look at the numbers, you look at what's happening, you look at jobs. Did I hear a new jobs number came out? A million and a half jobs? A million and a half jobs since Nov. 8 have been created. Well I think it's terrible I think it's despicable the amount of money that I hear being thrown around is ridiculous. Somebody said that this guy Steele that wrote it and we'll figure that out eventually that he paid money to the Russians. And frankly, if that was, in fact, Russia involved they don't like me very much just the opposite of what people were saying. And you know I have said over the last period of time the last person they want is me because I want a strong, strong military which I've proven in many ways and that was part of my campaign. And I also want lower oil prices and lots of oil which is not good for Russia. So I would think I would be the last one. But when you look at that horrible dossier which is a total phony fake deal like so much of the news that I read when you look at that and take a look at what's gone on with that and the kind of money we're talking about it is a disgrace. Well I heard the other day that it might be and then I heard that basically they started something but the Democrats really took it up and started it and then the question is did the FBI get involved with it. And did the FBI use it? Because if they did that's a real problem for them. So we'll find out. But I have a feeling that the Democrats started it I'm sure the conservatives started something else but it was a much more mellow situation and they did say they didn't hire Steele and the phony people that worked on it. But we're going to see. Look all I can say is that I have nothing to do with Russian collusion nothing whatsoever and everybody knows it and nobody really has even been able to find you know with all of these committee meetings. They walk out even the other side they say well there's been no collusion yet but we continue to look. I've been watching this for how long has it been a year? It's very unfair. It's very bad for our country. But with all of the work that the Democrats are trying to do to obstruct and to you know false charges every time I see them walking out they're saying even Dianne Feinstein that no collusion and I respect her for saying it. I'll be honest with no collusion. But there are at these meetings and they go through documents and there is no collusion. Well I think we found out something about him may be involved with or with certain nations and I don't even know exactly what it was in particular but there was a point at which we just felt Paul would be better off because we don't want to have any potential conflicts. And if there was a conflict I don't want to be involved in any conflicts even though it was I could have kept them longer. I don't think anybody would have complained. But we don't want to have any potential conflicts of interest at all. You know when it comes to Russia collusion. They're looking at the wrong person absolutely the wrong person. So I don't even to the best of my knowledge my lawyers told me I'm not even under investigation. I have not been told that at all. The lottery system has to end. And what we want, we want it very badly and we want it you know as far as immigration is concerned we've been treated so badly and we've handled immigration prior to me because we have been very tough on it but we've handled immigration in the United States so poorly. We want a merit-based system. I think we are. I think that we have a much tougher vetting process. I call it extreme vetting. We are very strong with our vetting. But people can slip through. But I say as strong as we are we have to get stronger. This person came in through a lottery and not only came in through a lottery but you have this whole system where you can bring people with you chain migration it's horrible it's horrible. Somebody had mentioned he may have brought. And he only had a green card. But twenty three people may have come in indirectly or directly through him. Now I don't want those people and family members whoever they may be I don't want them and you saw what he did and you saw his evilness because they go back to the town or they go back to the area where he grew up not where he's lived even you go back to the country as I understand it. I mean this is not the kind of people we want in the United States so we have to get rid of chain migration. What you just said we cannot just say oh well it's going to happen let's get used to it. We cannot allow it to happen. And we're getting I can tell you the Trump administration is getting tougher and tougher and tougher and we are now as you know looking at different forms of the wall. The wall is going to happen. I don't think I have it in here It's too bad. Does anybody have one? But we have literally a one-page form smaller than this is the size of that. People are fighting for right or wrong. I mean in some cases it's a good thing that they're fighting other cases. Everybody knows it's wrong but they're fighting nevertheless because people benefit by it. But it's a middle-class tax cut. There are many many things such as that right now totally up in the air. We're going to see you know the Senate has something to say about it too. I can tell you this The House has been amazing. I have watched what they've done and will look into make it as final as possible but the Senate is going to come out with their version and then everybody's going to sit in a room and hopefully it's going to happen. And you know if you listen to the fake media the fake news from some of these people like CNN they are so false in so many different networks. I mean the level of false reporting to me somebody said what's the biggest surprise. The amount of dishonesty of the press. But if you listen to a lot of the media you know I didn't do well with bills passed meaning Congress meaning Senate and House. Well a lot of people have been asking their question from long previous to me this is taking a long time ago we're just picking now a new head of the IRS and he will be looking at that I'm sure. But I have just made my decision as to who it is it will be announced very shortly and I'm sure they will be looking at that. I mean we're going to see what happens. I can tell you that there's not going to be something bad happening in terms of what we're going to do or maybe what they're going to do. But I can tell you that we are very very strong nation getting stronger all the time not only our economy but our military. You see what we've done with ISIS in eight months. I've done more than the previous administration done during the entire two terms of the administration, and we are going to have to solve problems like North Korea and North Korea is a big big problem. Hopefully, it can be worked out. Maybe it won't be able to but hopefully, it can be work. You know I'd love to be much more involved but I'm not supposed to be involved with Department of Justice so I have to hope that they run themselves well. But as you know as president you're not supposed to be involved with the Department of Justice. A lot of people ask me that question I give them that answer and they say oh now I understand. But they could very well be looking at it. I can say this Bernie Sanders was treated very badly. I'm not a fan of Bernie Sanders although we do agree with each other and trade. Trade deals are horrible but this country has made we have horrible trade deals, and I'm renegotiating those deals we're going to make them very good. We're going to terminate them frankly. NAFTA is horrible the deal we have with South Korea is horrible. We have so many bad deals. And Bernie Sanders actually agreed with me on that one point, and I actually got a lot of Bernie Sanders voters during the election as you possibly know better than I do. But what happened to Bernie Sanders with the DNC spearheaded by the Clintons and according to the new book by Donna Brazile was horrible. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I tell you that. I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg. I won't be doing that. And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race. That I can tell you. I don't have a racist bone in my body. Jeb Bush has to like the Mexican Illegals because of his wife. Do you know that Hillary Clinton was a birther? She wanted those records and fought like hell. People forgot. Did you know John McCain was a birther? The truth is we wouldn't be talking about illegal immigration if it weren't for me. I'm talking about Mexico is forcing people in that they don't want, and they want us to take care of those people. And I had an idea recently. When they send illegals into our country, we charge Mexico $100,000 for every illegal that crosses that border because it's trouble. He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured, OK? I think I'd get along very well with Vladimir Putin. I just think so. People say, ‘What do you mean?' I think I would get along well with him. You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever. I cherish women. I want to help women. I'm going to be able to do things for women that no other candidate would be able to do. When these people walk in the room, they don't say, Oh, hello! How's the weather? It's so beautiful outside. Isn't it lovely? How are the Yankees doing? Oh they're doing wonderful. Great. They say, We want deal! Sadly, she's no longer a 10. Well I really watch the shows. You really see a lot of great, you know, when you watch your show and all of the other shows, and you have the generals and you have certain people that you like. I have a plan, but … If I win, I don't want to broadcast to the enemy exactly what my plan is. Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?! I never attacked him on his looks and believe me, there's a lot of subject matter there. I have a great temperament. My temperament is very good, very calm. Everything I've done virtually has been a tremendous success. I've never seen anybody sweat like that. I'm looking at guys like Marco Rubio who has the worst voting record in the United States Senate. Young guy although he sweats more than any young person I've seen in my life. I've never seen a person sweat I have never seen a guy down water like he downs water. They bring it in in buckets for this guy. I believe in clean air. Immaculate air. … But I don't believe in climate change. Did you ever see a migration like that? They're all men, and they're all strong-looking guys. And I'm saying to myself: Why aren't they fighting to save Syria? Why are they migrating all over Europe? Seriously. It's really cold outside, they are calling it a major freeze, weeks ahead of normal. Man, we could use a big fat dose of global warming! I've done it four times out of hundreds, and I'm glad I did it. I used the laws of the country to my benefit. I'm sorry. I know more about ISIS than the generals do. Believe me. How stupid are the people of Iowa? How stupid are the people of the country to believe this crap? It's in the book that he's got a pathological temper. That's a big problem because you don't cure that as an example: child molesting. You don't cure these people. You don't cure a child molester. There's no cure for it. Pathological, there's no cure for that. When he said he stabbed somebody with a knife but it hit a belt buckle I know all about knives and belt buckles. He's running his country and at least he's a leader. You know, unlike what we have in this country. I know where she went, it's disgusting, I don't want to talk about it. No, it's too disgusting. I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters. If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of 'em, would you? Seriously. OK? Just knock the hell I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise. I promise. I would bring back waterboarding. And I'd bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding. Wow, Jeb Bush, whose campaign is a total disaster, had to bring in mommy to take a slap at me. Not nice! Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4&period;9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent. Putin called me a genius, I like him so far, I have to tell you. I'm the only one on this stage that said, ‘Do not go into Iraq. Do not attack Iraq. Nobody else on this stage said that. And I said it loud and strong. She should be running. Don't tell me it doesn't work torture works. Half these guys say: Torture doesn't work. Believe me, it works. If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS's ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been President because this would not have happened. I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go! Well just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke, OK? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don't know. I don't know, did he endorse me, or what's going on? Because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. And so you're asking me a question that I'm supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about. Part of the problem and part of the reason it takes so long is nobody wants to hurt each other anymore. I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. We're totally predictable. And predictable is bad. Sitting at a meeting like this and explaining my views and if I do become president, I have these views that are down for the other side to look at, you know. I hate being so open. The answer is that there has to be some form of punishment. Europe is a big place, I'm not going to take cards off the table. After I beat them, I'm going to be so presidential, you're going to be so bored, you're going to say, this is the most boring human being I've ever interviewed. Which is true, actually, I actually have low blood pressure, can you believe it? Can you believe it? I have like 100 over something. The doctor said, ‘Man you have the blood pressure of a great, great, athlete who is 20 years old. 110, I like that, because I like being a great athlete. Lock your doors folks, OK? Lock your doors. No, it's a big problem. We have our incompetent government people letting 'em in by the thousands, and who knows, who knows, maybe it's ISIS. He is just a guy who is a stubborn guy who eats like a slob. Do I look a president? How handsome am I, right? How handsome? We can't continue to allow China to rape our country, and that's what they're doing. I think the only card she has is the woman's card. She's got nothing else going. His father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being you know, shot. I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous. The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! I have borrowed, knowing that you can pay back with discounts. Now, we're in a different situation with the country. But I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal. And if the economy was good, it was good. So, therefore, you can't lose. First of all, you never have to default because you print the money, I hate to tell you, OK? So there's never a default. I'm the king of debt. I understand debt better than probably anybody. I know how to deal with debt, so well. I love debt. I would speak to him, I would have no problem speaking to him. I will give you everything. I'm the only one. I thought this would be like Dr&period; Martin Luther King, where the people would be lined up from here all the way to the Washington Monument. You're a sleaze. Look at my African-American here! Many of the thugs that attacked the peaceful Trump supporters in San Jose were illegals. They burned the American flag and laughed at police. He is a member of a club or society, very strongly pro-Mexican, which is all fine. But I say he's got bias. This judge has treated me very unfairly; he's treated me in a hostile manner. And there's something going on. I was the one that really broke the glass ceiling on behalf of women more than anybody in the construction industry, and my relationship, I think, is going to end up being very good with women. It's all because of me. And by the way, just so you know, I am the least racist person, the least racist person that you've ever seen, the least. Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart! They're trying to take over our children. They're pouring in and we don't know what we're doing. Based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Trump campaign, we are hereby revoking the press credentials of the phony and dishonest Washington Post. I feel like a supermodel except, like, times 10, OK? It's true. I'm a supermodel. I think profiling is something that we're going to have to start thinking about as a country. I don't think anybody should listen to me because I haven't really focused on it very much. Just arrived in Scotland. People are going wild over the vote. They took their country back. Just like we'll take our country back. No games. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country. That's what it is, too. It's a harsh word. It's a rape of our country. That could be a Mexican plane up there. They're getting ready to attack. Where is the outrage for this Disney book? Is this the Star of David also? Dishonest media! Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. If you look at his wife, she was standing there, she had nothing to say. Probably maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say, you tell me, but plenty of people have written that. She was extremely quiet and it looked like she had nothing to say. He's not going into Ukraine, OK, just so you understand. He's not going to go into Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down. You can put it down. You can take it anywhere you want. The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were. I always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier. Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish, the Second Amendment. By the way, and if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people maybe there is, I don't know. But I'll tell you what, that will be a horrible day. He is the founder of ISIS. He's the founder of ISIS, OK? He's the founder. He founded ISIS and I would say the co-founder would be crooked Hillary Clinton. You're living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs. Fifty-eight percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose? And at the end of four years, I guarantee you that I will get over 95 percent of the African-American vote. I promise you. Because I will produce. Mexico will pay for the wall! I think people don't care about my tax returns. I don't think anybody cares, except some members of the press. I just don't bother talking about it but I don't know. I guess with maybe some, I don't know why, I really don't know why. Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever. Ever. Ever. I would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically. He's a fantastic guy. He took control of Egypt. And he really took control of it. This was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago. Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended. We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years. We've got to be nice and cool, nice and calm. All right, stay on point, Donald. Stay on point. No sidetracks, Donald. Nice and easy. And, I don't know, we have so many more. Anybody I forgot? Right? Everything okay? Good, I got it. You, I remember more than anybody. Thank you all very much. I appreciate it. And to the congressmen and congresswomen, we very much appreciate you all being here. Thank you very much. Before we begin, I'd like to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana. As we all know, our Gulf Coast was hit over the weekend with a devastating hurricane of historic proportion. Torrential rains and terrible flooding continue to pose a grave danger to life and to property. Our first responders have been doing absolutely heroic work to shepherd people out of harm's way, and their courage and devotion has saved countless lives. They represent truly the very best of America. We must be vigilant. We must protect the lives of our people. I was on the ground in Texas yesterday to meet with Governor Abbott who is doing, by the way, and incredible job and local officials so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response. In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve. We see friend helping friend, neighbor helping neighbor, and stranger helping stranger. And together, we will endure and we will overcome. To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are here with you every single step of the way. And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room every step of the way. To those Americans who have lost loved ones: All of America is grieving with you, and our hearts are joined with yours forever. The citizens of Texas and the Gulf Coast need all the prayers, support, and resources our communities have to offer. Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the resilience of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. To the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we will be with you every single day after to restore, recover, and rebuild. As our thoughts and prayers remain firmly with the citizens and our fellow people people great, great people all affected by this tragedy. We're also glad to be back in the heartland with the very, very fine folks of Missouri. And I said to Senator Blunt and I said to Billy Long on the plane coming in can I say Missouri, or should I say Missouruh? Okay? And they said, whatever you want is okay. So I said, good. But I'm especially pleased to be here in Springfield, the birthplace of a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. Who would have known that? This is the place where the Main Street of America got its start, and this is where America's main street will begin its big, beautiful comeback that you are seeing it right now. This is a comeback of historic proportions. You're seeing it happen right now. Right? You're seeing it. We're here today to launch our plans to bring back Main Street by reducing the crushing tax burden on our companies and on our workers. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. And you have seen what's happening with regulations they're going fast. We need regulations, but many of them are unnecessary, and they're going fast. That is why the foundation of our job creation agenda is to fundamentally reform our tax code for the first time in more than 30 years. I want to work with Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, on a plan that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker and pro-American. There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in the American heartland, surrounded by hardworking men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none. And, by the way, before I start, Ivanka Trump I see my beautiful daughter is in the audience. Stand up, honey. She's working very hard. I'm very proud of Ivanka. For many decades, Route 66 captured the American spirit. The communities along this historic route were a vivid symbol of America's booming industry. Truck drivers hauled made-in-America goods along this vital artery of commerce. Families passed through bustling towns on their way to explore the great American West. And high-quality manufacturing jobs lifted up communities, gave Americans a paycheck that could support a family. Mr&period; Cook is a great example of the people that do it. Stand up. Stand up Mr&period; Cook. Stand up. I think they like you. And provided millions of our fellow citizens with the pride and dignity that comes with work. But, in recent years, millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror. And it wasn't pleasant to watch, especially for me. I would sit back I was in business and I could see what was happening. It wasn't good. If we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore opportunity, then we must reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers. In the last 10 years, our economy has grown at only around two percent a year. If you look at other countries and you look at what their GDP is, they're unhappy when it's seven, eight, nine. And I speak to them leaders of the countries how are you doing? Not well, not well. Why? GDP is down to seven percent. And I'm saying, we were hitting one percent just a number of months ago. So we're going to change that around, folks, that I can tell you. And we're going change it around fast. And today a very appropriate day that this should happen we just announced that we hit three percent in GDP. It just came out. And on a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration, during an eight-year period, never hit three percent. So we're really on our way. If we achieve sustained three percent growth, that means 12 million new jobs and $10 trillion dollars of new economic activity over the next decade. That's some numbers. And I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent. There's no reason why we shouldn't. So this is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver real tax reform for everyday hardworking Americans, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done. And I don't want to be disappointed by Congress, do you understand me? Do you understand? Congress I think Congress is going to make a comeback. I hope so. I tell you what, the United States is counting on it. Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. That means getting rid of the loopholes and complexity that primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans and special interests. Our last major tax rewrite was 31 years ago. It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest tax breaks, reduced the number of tax brackets from fifteen to two, and lowered tax rates for both individuals and businesses. At the time, it was really something special. Since then, our tax laws have tripled in size, and the tax code itself now spans more than 2,600 pages, and most of it is not understandable. Tax rates have increased, and special interest loopholes have crept back into the system. The tax code is now a massive source of complexity and frustration for tens of millions of Americans. In 1935, the basic 1040 form that most people file had two simple pages of instructions. Today, that basic form has one hundred pages of instructions, and it's pretty complex stuff. The tax code is so complicated that more than 90 percent of Americans need professional help to do their own taxes. This enormous complexity is very unfair. It disadvantages ordinary Americans who don't have an army of accountants while benefitting deep-pocketed special interests. And most importantly, this is wrong. Thank you. First and foremost, our tax system should benefit loyal, hardworking Americans and their families. That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes and I'm speaking against myself when I do this, I have to tell you. And I might be speaking against Mr&period; Cook, and we're both okay with it, is that right? It's crazy. We're speaking maybe we shouldn't be doing this, you know? But we're doing the right thing. True. And allow the vast majority of our citizens to file their taxes on a single, simple page without having to hire an accountant. Second, we need a competitive tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans. It's time to give American workers the pay raise that they've been looking for for many, many years. In 1986, Ronald Reagan led the world by cutting our corporate tax rate to 34 percent. That was below the average rate for developed countries at the time. Everybody thought that was a monumental thing that happened. But then, under this pro-America system, our economy boomed. It just went beautifully right through the roof. The middle class thrived and median family income increased. Other countries saw the success. They looked at us. They saw what is America doing? What's happening with the United States? And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours. Over the past 30 years, the average business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent. And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, China and some others that are highly competitive, and really doing very well against us. They are taking us, frankly, to the cleaners. So we must we have no choice we must lower our taxes. And your Senator, Claire McCaskill, she must do this for you. And if she doesn't do it for you, you have to have to vote her out of office. She's got to make that commitment. She's got to make that commitment. If she doesn't do it, you just can't do this anymore, with the obstruction and the obstructionists. If we don't get tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever we are looking for the biggest ever jobs and our country cannot take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that. But, at a minimum, they won't take off the way they should. The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare. Not one vote. We got not one vote to try and fix healthcare and get rid of Obamacare. The strategy of our economic rivals has worked. They made their taxes lower and far lower, in many cases, than ours and jobs left our country. Large corporations changed their business models by exporting jobs to other countries and then shipping their goods back to the United States, where they'd make massive profits, and they wouldn't be paying tax to us either. So we lost the jobs, we lost the taxes, they closed the buildings, they closed the plants and factories. We got nothing but unemployment. We got nothing. Other businesses even classic American brands switched their headquarters to foreign countries. Because of this and other reasons, like weak borders, America remains stuck in the past. Although I have to tell you, we have General Kelly here today, and we stopped 78 percent going up to 80 percent on the border traffic coming through, in just a short period of time. He has done some job. A whole different world out there right now. Today, we are still taxing our businesses at 35 percent, and it's way more than that. And think of it: In some cases, way above 40 percent when you include state and local taxes, in various states. The United States is now behind France, behind Germany, behind Canada, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and many other nations. Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive trade deficits numbers that you would not believe. But this administration is going to fix that. One by one, we're fixing it. We're working right now on NAFTA the horrible, terrible NAFTA deal that took so much business out of your state and out of your cities and towns, and we're working on it. Let's see what happens. Mexico is not happy. But as I told them, you made a lot of money for a lot of years and everybody left you alone. We got to change this deal. And hopefully we can renegotiate it. But if we can't, we'll terminate it and we'll start all over again with a real deal. So when it comes to the business tax, we are dead last. Can you believe that? So this cannot be allowed to continue any longer. America must lead the way, not follow from behind. We have gone from a tax rate that is lower than our economic competitors, to one that is more than 60 percent higher. We have totally surrendered our competitive edge to other countries. We have totally surrendered. We're not surrendering anymore. Ideally and I say this for our Secretary of the Treasury we would like to bring our business tax rate down to 15 percent, which would make our tax rate lower than most countries, but still, by no means the lowest, unfortunately, in the world. But it would make us highly competitive. In other words, foreign companies have more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies. They can pay their workers more, sell their products and services at lower cost, and still make more money than their U.S. competitors. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage. We must reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, create jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in America the America we love. Thank you. Thank you very much. Because when businesses compete for labor, your wages will go up. Lower taxes on American business means higher wages for American workers, and it means more products made right here in the USA. When I was growing up, I always used to see the signs, and it was always stamped on the product: Made in the USA. You don't see it anymore. We're going to go back to Made in the USA Made in the USA. The third principle for tax reform is a crucial one: tax relief for middle-class families. In a way and I've been saying this for a long time they've been sort of the forgotten people, but they're not forgotten any longer. I can tell you that. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can keep more of their hard-earned paychecks, and they can do lots of things with those paychecks. And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but that means they'll go out, and they'll spend their money. And it will be a beautiful thing to watch. This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of raising a family. That's so important to Ivanka Trump. Very, very important to everybody in this room, but so important to my daughter. It's one of her real big beliefs. And she's very committed to that. Right, Ivanka? We believe that ordinary Americans know better than Washington how to spend their own money, and we want to help them take home as much of their money as possible and then spend it. So they'll keep their money. They'll spend their money. They'll buy our product. Our factories will be moving again. Companies are going to move back into our country, jobs are going to prosper, and our country is going to be just like it says on that beautiful red hat it says: Make America Great Again. That's what we're going to do. Right? Fourth and finally, we want to bring back trillions of dollars in wealth that's parked overseas. Because of our high tax rate and horrible, outdated, bureaucratic rules, large companies that do business overseas will often park their profits offshore to avoid paying a high United States tax if the money is brought back home. So they leave the money over there. The amount of money we're talking about is anywhere from $3 trillion to $5 trillion. Can you believe that? By making it less punitive for companies to bring back this money, and by making the process far less bureaucratic and difficult, we can return trillions and trillions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. It's time to invest in our country, to rebuild our communities, and to hire our great American workers. My administration is embracing a new economic model. It's called very simply: The American Model. Under this system, we will encourage companies to hire and grow in America, to raise wages for American workers, and to help rebuild our American cities and communities. That is how we will all succeed and grow together, as one team, with one shared sense of purpose, and one glorious American destiny. So today I'm calling on all members of Congress Democrat, Republican and independent to support pro-American tax reform. They have to do it. It's time. They have to do it. It is time. I'm calling on Congress to provide a level playing field for our workers and our companies, to attract new companies and businesses to our shores, and to put more money into the pockets of everyday, hardworking people and also into the pockets of our companies so they can continue to grow and expand. What could possibly be more bipartisan than allowing families to keep more of what they earn and creating an environment for real job and wage growth in the country that we love so much? So let's put or at least try to put the partisan posturing behind us and come together as Americans to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve. If we do this, if we unite in the name of common sense and the name of common good, then we will add millions and millions of new jobs, bring back trillions of dollars, and we will give America the competitive advantage that it so desperately needs and has been looking for for so long. It's time. Products made with American hands, American labor, and American grit will once again be delivered throughout the world. It's true. It's time. Instead of exporting our jobs, we will export our goods. Our jobs will both stay here in America and come back to America. We'll have it both ways. Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work. They will love getting up in the morning. They will love going to their job. They will love earning a big, fat, beautiful paycheck. They will be proud again. That is the future I want for our people. That is the future I want for America a nation where we are proud, prosperous, united, and free. Today, I am asking every citizen to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things beautiful things for our country. I am asking every member of Congress, of which we have many with us today, to join me in unleashing America's full potential. I am asking everyone in this room and across the nation to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our people. And if we do these things, and if we care for and support each other, and love each other, then we will truly make America great again. And massive amounts of water, food, and supplies, by the way, are being delivered on an hourly basis. It's something that nobody has ever seen before from this country, I can tell you that. And I'm very proud of all of the folks that have worked so hard in FEMA, all of our first responders, all of our police that have gone to the island because their police force has been so badly affected. And many of their policemen in fact, most of the police people have lost their homes, and it's been a tough go. But we are we're going to get it back. Before we go on to discuss the largest tax cut in our county's history, I also want to provide a brief update on healthcare. We have the votes on Graham-Cassidy. But with the rules of reconciliation, we're up against a deadline of Friday two days. That's just two days. And yes-vote senator we have a wonderful senator, great, great senator who is a yes vote, but he's home recovering from a pretty tough situation. And with so many great features, including all of the block granting, the money to the states, et cetera, et cetera, our healthcare plan is really going to be something excellent. It's going to be better managed for the people that it serves. Having local healthcare representatives is far better than having healthcare managed from Washington, D.C. Not even a contest. And many, many governors, as you also see, have agreed with us and approved it and really look forward to running it properly. But again, because the reconciliation window is about to close, we have to wait a few months until it reopens before we take a vote. So we're getting all of the good signs from Alaska and the others to repeal and replace Obamacare. And I was hoping this would be put on my desk right after we won the election, and I'd come in and sign. But it didn't work that way. There were a couple of people that I won't say anything. But early next year when reconciliation kicks back in, in any event long before the November election, we're going to have a vote. And we're going to be able to get that through, and I think we'll actually get it through very easily and the time makes it easier. But speaking of reconciliation, the Republican Senate needs to get rid of the filibuster rule, which is blocking so many great legislative reforms the American people badly want and deserve. By the way, the Democrats, if they had the opportunity, which hopefully they won't for many, many years, they would get rid of it on day one. And most of you know exactly what I'm talking about. We're here today in Indiana to announce our framework to deliver historic tax relief to the American People. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and I guess it's probably something I can say that I'm very good at. I've been waiting for this for a long time. We're going to cut taxes for the middle class, make the tax code simpler and more fair for everyday Americans, and we are going to bring back the jobs and wealth that have left our country and most people thought left our country for good. We want tax reform that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, and, yes, tax reform that is pro-American. It's time to take care of our people, to rebuild our nation, and to fight for our great American workers. Indiana is a tremendous example of the prosperity that is unleashed when we cut taxes and set free the dreams of our citizens. This state has claimed a powerful competitive edge built on low taxes and less regulation and are we cutting regulation? And businesses all across the country have taken notice. In recent years, Indiana has welcomed dozens of companies fleeing high taxes and high-tax states. Thousands of new jobs and massive capital investment have followed meaning a better quality of life for the people of Indiana. All of this is possible because the people of this state have made a decision. They chose to make Indiana competitive again. They chose, and their choice was so important. It included electing a governor, who you may have heard of laughter who signed the largest income tax cut in the state's history, our very, very terrific person and terrific Vice President, Mike Pence. It's time for Washington to learn from the wisdom of Indiana. We need Washington to promote American jobs instead of obstructing them. That is what I have been working to achieve every day since I took office. That is what I talked about on the campaign trail. Already, we're seeing the results of an economic policy that finally puts America first. Unemployment is at a 16-year low. Unemployment for African Americans is near its lowest point since the turn of the millennium. It's really a fantastic thing to see. Wages are rising. Optimism among manufacturers has reached all-time highs. GDP growth last quarter reached 3 percent way ahead of schedule; nobody thought that was going to happen for a long time. And this quarter, I believe, would have been better, but the hurricanes will have an impact. But other than that, it would have been, in my opinion, even better. Your government is working for you once again, not for the donors, not the special interests, but the hardworking taxpaying citizens of our country. America is back on the right track. And I see so many red hats Make America Great Again. That's what we're doing Make America Great Again. But our country and our economy cannot take off like they should unless we dramatically reform America's outdated, complex, and extremely burdensome tax code. It's a relic. We've got to change it. We have to compete compete with other countries. The current tax system is a colossal barrier standing in the way of America's economic comeback because it can be far greater than it's ever been. But we're going to remove that barrier to create the tax system our people finally, finally, finally and want and deserve. For several months, my administration has been working closely with Congress to develop a framework for tax reform. Over the next few months, the House and Senate will build on this framework and produce legislation that will deliver more jobs, higher pay, and lower taxes for middle-class families for the working man and woman and for businesses of all sizes. I look forward Thank you. I look forward to working with Congress to deliver these historic tax cuts and reforms to the American people. These tax cuts are significant. There's never been tax cuts like what we're talking about. Our framework is based on four key ideas: First, we will cut taxes for the everyday, hardworking Americans the people that work so long, so hard, and they've been forgotten. But they're not forgotten anymore. I think we proved that on November 8th. Under this framework, the first $12,000 of income earned by a single individual will be tax free, and a married couple won't pay a dime in taxes on their first $24,000 of income. So, a married couple up to $24,000 can spend their money on their family, on their children, on what they have to do. So much better. In other words, more income for more people will be taxed at a rate of zero. At this zero percent rate, taxable income will be subject to just three tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent. Jonathan does industrial janitorial work and Jamie works at an auto company. Together they're raising four beautiful children, and last year they earned less than $90,000. Under our tax plan they would have saved more than $1,000, and it could be substantially more. And that's just on federal taxes. So they would have saved at least $1,000. Middle-income families will save even more money with an increased child tax credit for children under the age of 17, which so many families have been calling for. We will eliminate the marriage penalty in the existing credit and expand eligibility to include even more middle-income families. Greatly expanded. We're also expanding the child tax credit because we believe the most important investment our country can make is in our children. And this is just one more critical way that we're targeting relief to working families. In addition, under our framework, those caring for the elderly loved and we love these people, but we're caring, and we take such care of the elderly and other adult dependents will receive financial relief in the form of a $500 tax credit. We're doing everything we can to reduce the tax burden on you and your family. By eliminating tax breaks and loopholes, we will ensure that the benefits are focused on the middle class, the working men and women, not the highest-income earners. Our framework includes our explicit commitment that tax reform will protect low-income and middle-income households, not the wealthy and well-connected. They can call me all they want. It's not going to help. I'm doing the right thing, and it's not good for me. Believe me. But what is good for me not only as President and legacy what is good for me is if everything takes off like a rocket ship, like it should have for 20 years. That's good for me. That's good for everyone. And that's what I think is going to happen. And a lot of very wealthy people feel the same way, believe me. In fact, we are eliminating most itemized deductions that primarily benefit the wealthiest taxpayers. We've also given Congress the flexibility to add an additional top rate on the very highest income earners to provide even more tax relief for working people. Second, our framework will make the tax code simple, fair, and easy to understand, finally. Americans waste money. Americans waste so much money billions and billions of dollars and many hours each year to comply with our ridiculously complex tax code. More than 90 percent of Americans use assistance to prepare their taxes. Under our framework, the vast majority of families will be able to file their taxes on a single sheet of paper. We are also repealing the alternative minimum tax, or AMT. About time. The AMT is actually a shadow tax system that requires many people to calculate their taxes two different ways and pay the higher of the two amounts. You're all familiar with it. Under our framework, the AMT will make even less sense because we are repealing many of the special interest tax breaks that it was designed to deal with. We are making our taxes simple again. We are simplifying our tax system. To protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer, we are finally ending the crushing, the horrible, the unfair estate tax, or as it is often referred to, the death tax. That means, especially for all of you with small businesses that are really tremendous businesses, you'll be able to leave them to your family, and your family won't have to run out and do a fire sale to try and get the money to pay the tax lose the business, ends up going out of business. All of those jobs are lost. The farmers in particular are affected. They have wonderful farms, but they can't pay the tax, so they have to sell the farm. The people that buy it don't run it with love. They can't run it the same way, and it goes out. So that death tax is a disaster for this country and a disaster for so many small businesses and farmers. And we're getting rid of it. Now if you don't like your family, it won't matter, okay? But for those that love your family, it matters a lot. With us today is Kip Tom, a family farmer from Leesburg Where's Kip? Go ahead, Kip. Hi, Kip who fears that his family's farming heritage it's been a long time. How long, Kip? A hundred and eighty-seven years that's peanuts, Kip. Wow. That's a long time. But that great heritage could come to an end because of the death tax, or the estate tax, and could make it impossible for him to pass that legacy to his wonderful family. We're not going to let that happen. We are not going to allow the death tax to steal away the American Dream from these great, great families, many of which are in this room today. We will protect our farmers, our ranchers, and our small businesses, and we will make taxes simple, easy, and fair for all Americans. Okay? Third, we will cut taxes on American businesses to restore our competitive edge and create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. In Indiana, you have seen firsthand that cutting taxes on businesses makes your state more competitive and leads to more jobs and higher paychecks for your workers. Now, we want to do the same thing for America, making our country more competitive with other nations. And in many cases, those other nations are taking advantage of us in so many ways. They say they're friends, and perhaps they are, but believe me, I am renegotiating our trade deals, including NAFTA, including many other trade deals. And through regulation, all you have to do is look at the massive pipelines Dakota Access. You take a look, 48,000 jobs immediately approved. So we're letting that happen. But in terms of the tax and the tax strategy that Ronald Reagan used to create an economic boom in the 1980s: When our economy took off, the middle class thrived, and the family income of all families was increasing more and more. And it was a beautiful sight to behold. Since then, other nations have adopted, unfortunately, our playbook and ran it even better than we did. And I shouldn't say even better because we didn't run it well at all, and we let other nations come in and take advantage of us and take our jobs away and take our businesses out. And we're stopping that, and you see it right here what we've done. Today, our total business tax rate is 60 percent higher than our average foreign competitor in the developed world. That's not good. We have surrendered our competitive edge to other countries, but we're not surrendering anymore. We're not surrendering anymore. Under our framework, we will dramatically cut the business tax rate so that American companies and American workers can beat our foreign competitors and start winning again. We will reduce the corporate tax rate to no higher than 20 percent. That's way down from 35 and 39 which is substantially below the average of other industrialized nations. This is a revolutionary change, and the biggest winners will be the everyday American workers as jobs start pouring into our country, as companies start competing for American labor, and as wages start going up at levels that you haven't seen in many years. When our companies move to other countries, it's our loyal American workers who get hurt. And when companies stay in America, and come to America, it's our wonderful workers who reap the rewards. And I just left the United Nations last week, and I was told by one of the most powerful leaders of the world that they're going to be announcing, in the not-too-distant future, five major factories in the United States between increasing and new five. You'll be hearing about that very soon. And I said thank you very much, and he said, you know what? It's starting to happen in the United States. It's starting to happen. So I just wanted to let you know that. I promised I wouldn't say who. I'll keep my word. Okay? Unless you force me. Members of both parties it happens to be in the automobile industry. That's a good industry. Members of both parties should agree that we need a tax code that keeps jobs in our country and brings jobs back to our country. And for the millions of small businesses and farms that file their taxes as sole proprietors, S corporations or partnerships, we will cap the tax rate they pay at 25 percent much lower. Big difference. This will be the lowest top marginal income tax rate for small and mid-size businesses in this country in more than 80 years. To give businesses even more reason to boost their investment in America, for the next five years, our framework will allow to fully write off listen to this the cost of equipment in the year they buy it. That is big. And that's instead of having to take deductions and deduct the cost over a long period of time. Now that's called incentive. That's called incentive. This will be tremendously important to help American businesses afford the heavy industrial machinery and other capital investments they need to grow big and grow strong. Joining us today is John Gannon, the owner of a custom wood fencing and deck construction company in Indianapolis. John is the father of nine children, and recently celebrated his 35th wedding anniversary. Congratulations, John. And John is in the fencing company, as you heard, and I'm just thinking I have to mention this you know, we have a fence around the White House. We have a fence around the White House, and they want to build a new fence. And I figured, you know I'm pretty good at construction I figured, I don't know, maybe a million, maybe a million-and-a-half. And this has been taking place over a long period of time previous administrations. So I said, how much is the fence you're talking around the White House? Sir, the fence will cost approximately $50 million. I said, What? I kid you not, and we have thousands of things like that. Thousands. We're going to get it all down, but think of that: $50 million. Now, I assume it's a strong fence. Okay? So, John, do you think you could do it for slightly less than $50 million? I think he could take $49 off right now and he'd have plenty of profit. Right? Right, John? It's crazy. It's crazy. Never understand it, but we're working on it. John says that a tax cut like we're proposing will make his business more competitive, allowing him to expand, hire more workers, and raise wages for his current employees. Right, John? Also with us is Aaron Williams, a father of two who works in the field of information technology. Where's Aaron? Hello, Aaron. Hi. It's a good field. Aaron has seen the disastrous effects of high and just literally, high corporate tax rates right up close and personal, as more and more high-tech jobs are shipped overseas. You've been watching it, Aaron. Right? All over. Like millions of other Americans, Aaron wants to bring those jobs back to the United States. We're going to reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they can keep jobs in America, Aaron; create jobs in America; compete for workers in America; and raise wages right here in America. You're going to be in a much different position. Okay? Thank you. Tremendous incentives. We want more products proudly stamped with those four beautiful words: Made in the USA. Right? Made in the USA. Finally, our framework encourages American companies to bring back the trillions and trillions of dollars in wealth that's parked overseas. Our current tax system trillions. And by the way, for years I've been hearing it's to two point five trillion. So I've been hearing this for about five years, so I assume it's much more. Right? But Democrats want to do it, and Republicans want to do it. For years who doesn't want to do it? They want to bring but they can't do it because it's so restrictive, and the taxes are so ridiculous. So they can't do it. So the money stays in other countries, and it's invested in other countries. We want to bring it back. But think of it, it's one of the few things Democrats want it and Republicans want it. So they both want it, and yet for years they haven't been able to do it. Now we're doing it. We're doing things. You know, it's one thing when we want a healthcare and they want a healthcare, and there's a dispute. But here's something everybody wants and they can't do it. So you can tell you, there's a broken system in D.C., but we're getting it fixed rather I think rather rapidly. You'll be seeing that over the next few months. Our current tax system makes us one of the few developed nations in the world to punish our companies when they bring wealth earned overseas back into our country. We're punishing them for bringing the money back in. As a result, corporations have parked many trillions of dollars in foreign countries, and many have incorporated abroad in order to avoid our punitive tax system altogether. And some companies actually leave our country because they have so much money overseas so much, it's an incredible amount that they move the company to get their money. We're going to let them bring the money back home. Our framework will stop punishing companies for keeping their headquarters in the United States. We're punishing companies under our codes for being in the United States. We will impose a one-time low tax on returning money that is already offshore so that it can be brought back home to America where it belongs and where it can be put to work and work and work. The framework I've just described represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reduce taxes, rebuild our economy, and restore America's competitive edge. Finally. And I have to say, just before coming here we released some of the details of the tax and the tax reform and the tax cuts, and it has really received tremendous, tremendous reviews. And if Senator Donnelly doesn't approve it, because you know he's on the other side, we will come here. We will campaign against him like you wouldn't believe. I think they're going to approve it. I think we'll have actually, I think we'll have numerous Democrats come across because it's the right thing to do. These reforms will be a dramatic change from a failed tax system that encourages American businesses to ship jobs to foreign countries that have much lower tax rates. It's what we can't do. Our competitors have much lower tax rates. But no longer. My administration strongly rejects this offshoring model, and we have embraced the new model. It's called the American model. Under the American model, we are reducing burdens on our businesses as long as they do business in our country. That's what we want. We want them to do business in our country, not to leave our country like a number of firms from Indiana. Some made some great promises to me, but those promises are only being partially kept because they're incentivized to leave. But now they're going to be incentivized to stay. And if that doesn't work, then we'll get even tougher than that. Okay? We want our companies to hire and grow in America and to raise wages for American workers, and to help rebuild American cities and towns. That is how we will all succeed together and grow together as one team, one people, and one American family. We want it to happen here. Tax reform has not historically been a partisan issue, and it does not have to be a partisan issue today. I really believe we're going to have numerous Democrats come over and sign because it's the right thing to do. I believe that it's the right thing to do, and I know many of them. And they're telling me it is the right thing to do. President Reagan's tax cuts were passed with significant bipartisan majorities at a time when there was a Democrat majority in the House and a Democrat Speaker Tip O'Neill. Before that, Democrat President John F. Kennedy championed tax cuts that surged the economy and massively reduced unemployment. As President Kennedy very wisely said, The single most important fiscal weapon available to strengthen the national economy is the federal tax policy. The right kind of tax cut at the right time at the right time, this is the right time is the most effective measure that this government could take to spur our economy forward. That was President Kennedy. My fellow Americans, this is the right tax cut, and this is the right time. Democrats and Republicans in Congress should come together, finally, to deliver this giant win for the American people and begin middle-class miracle it's called a middle-class miracle, once again. It's also called a miracle for our great companies; a miracle for the middle class, for the working person. I truly believe that many Democrats want to support our plan, and with enough encouragement from the American people, they will find the courage to do what is right for our great country. But they'll only do it if you, the American people, make your voices heard. Only if you tell Congress to give us a tax code that puts American jobs first. And that's what we're doing. History has proven time and time again that there is no power on Earth more awesome than the will of the American people. That is why today I am asking all Americans Republican, Democrat, independent to join with me, and with each other to demand tax reform that will truly, truly, truly make America great again. Call your congressmen. Call your senators. Let them know you're watching. Let them know you're waiting. Tell them that today is the day for decision. That now is the time to heal this self-inflicted economic wound. And that with their action, the future will belong to all of us. If you demand it, the politicians will listen. They will answer, and they will act. And someday, many years from now, our children and our grandchildren will remember this moment in history as the time when ordinary Americans took control of their destiny and chose a future of American patriotism, prosperity, and pride. With your help and your voice, we will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our wealth, and for every citizen across this land, we will bring back our great American dreams. I authorized Zero access to White House actually turned him down many times for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don't exist. Look at this guy's past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve! The Fake News Media barely mentions the fact that the Stock Market just hit another New Record and that business in the U.S. is booming… but the people know! Can you imagine if O was president and had these numbers would be biggest story on earth! Dow now over 25,000. Dow goes from 18,589 on November 9, 2016, to 25,075 today, for a new all-time Record. Jumped 1000 points in last 5 weeks, Record fastest 1000 point move in history. This is all about the Make America Great Again agenda! Jobs, Jobs, Jobs. Six trillion dollars in value created! Well, now that collusion with Russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with Hillary Clinton and the FBI/Russia, the Fake News Media and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable. They should try winning an election. Sad! Michael Wolff is a total loser who made up stories in order to sell this really boring and untruthful book. He used Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad! The African American unemployment rate fell to 6.8%, the lowest rate in 45 years. I am so happy about this News! And, in the Washington Post of all places, headline states, Trumps first year jobs numbers were very, very good. Brian Ross, the reporter who made a fraudulent live newscast about me that drove the Stock Market down 350 points billions of dollars, was suspended for a month but is now back at ABC NEWS in a lower capacity. He is no longer allowed to report on Trump. Should have been fired! Now that Russian collusion, after one year of intense study, has proven to be a total hoax on the American public, the Democrats and their lapdogs, the Fake News Mainstream Media, are taking out the old Ronald Reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart. Crooked Hillary Clinton also played these cards very hard and, as everyone knows, went down in flames. I went from VERY successful businessman, to top T.V. Star to President of the United States, on my first try. I think that would qualify as not smart, but genius… and a very stable genius at that! Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind. Steve was a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination by defeating seventeen candidates, often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the Republican party. Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn't as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans. Steve doesn't represent my base he's only in it for himself. Steve pretends to be at war with the media, which he calls the opposition party, yet he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was. It is the only thing he does well. Steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books. We have many great Republican members of Congress and candidates who are very supportive of the Make America Great Again agenda. Like me, they love the United States of America and are helping to finally take our country back and build it up, rather than simply seeking to burn it all down. So many of the people that I talk about in terms of fake news actually came to the defense of this great administration, and even myself, because they know the author, and they know he's a fraud, this book is a work of fiction. You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the p**sy. You can do anything. Nobody respects women more than me. Why can't we use nuclear weapons? If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although, the Second Amendment people. Maybe there is. I don't know. When Iran, when they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats, and they make gestures at our people that they shouldn't be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water. That makes me smart. Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. I've been treated very unfairly by this judge. Now, this judge is of Mexican heritage. I'm building a wall, OK? I'm building a wall. I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense, OK? He's not a war hero. He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured. Now, the poor guy, you've got to see this guy, Ah, I don't know what I said! I don't remember! I'm also honored to have the greatest temperament that anybody has. I don't think Ivanka would do that, although she does have a very nice figure. I've said if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her. I sorta get away with things like that. I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters, okay? It's, like, incredible. We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated. We have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out. 40 Wall Street actually was the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan… And now it's the tallest. Actually, I was only kidding. You can get that baby out of here. Don't worry, I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I'm speaking. That's OK People don't understand. That's OK. I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me… I would bomb the shit out of them. You know what I wanted to. I wanted to hit a couple of those speakers so hard. I would have hit them. No, no. I was going to hit them, I was all set and then I got a call from a highly respected governor… I was gonna hit one guy in particular, a very little guy. I was gonna hit this guy so hard his head would spin and he wouldn't know what the hell happened… I was going to hit a number of those speakers so hard their heads would spin, they'd never recover. And that's what I did with a lot, that's why I still don't have certain people endorsing me: they still haven't recovered. I think I've made a lot of sacrifices. I work very, very hard. I've created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures. I've had tremendous success. I think I've done a lot. Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart! I love the old days, you know? You know what I hate? There's a guy totally disruptive, throwing punches, we're not allowed punch back anymore. I'd like to punch him in the face, I'll tell ya. He referred to my hands, if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee it. You know, it really doesn't matter what they write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of ass. Look at my African American over here! His father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being… you know, shot. I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous. What is this, right prior to his being shot, and nobody even brings it up. They don't even talk about that. That was reported, and nobody talks about it. My entire life, I've watched politicians bragging about how poor they are, how they came from nothing, how poor their parents and grandparents were. And I said to myself, if they can stay so poor for so many generations, maybe this isn't the kind of person we want to be electing to higher office. How smart can they be? They're morons. I know where she went, it's disgusting, I don't want to talk about it. No, it's too disgusting. Don't say it, it's disgusting. Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president I mean, she's a woman, and I'm not supposed to ​say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious? I don't think I've made mistakes. Every time somebody said I made a mistake, they do the polls and my numbers go up, so I guess I haven't made any mistakes. I don't think I'm going to lose, but if I do, I don't think you're ever going to see me again, folks. I think I'll go to Turnberry and play golf or something. Well, I'll tell you the funniest is that I'll go backstage before a show, and everyone's getting dressed and ready and everything else, and you know, no men are anywhere. And I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant and therefore I'm inspecting it. You know, I'm inspecting, I want to make sure that everything is good. You know, the dresses. Is everyone okay? You know, they're standing there with no clothes. Is everybody okay? And you see these incredible looking women, and so, I sort of get away with things like that. But no, I've been very good. Don't worry, ladies, I've seen it all before. With all of the failed experts weighing in, does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn't firm, strong and willing to commit our total might against the North. Fools, but talks are a good thing! As Americans, you need identification, sometimes in a very strong and accurate form, for almost everything you do… except when it comes to the most important thing, VOTING for the people that run your country. Push hard for Voter Identification! Many mostly Democrat States refused to hand over data from the 2016 Election to the Commission On Voter Fraud. They fought hard that the Commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally. System is rigged, must go to Voter I.D. tock Market had another good day but, now that the Tax Cut Bill has passed, we have tremendous upward potential. Dow just short of 25,000, a number that few thought would be possible this soon into my administration. Also, unemployment went down to 4.1%. Only getting better! I will be announcing THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR on Monday at 5:00 o'clock. Subjects will cover Dishonesty & Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media. Stay tuned! North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times. Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works! It's not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing, but also many other countries, and others. As an example, we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don't even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel. We have taken Jerusalem, the toughest part of the negotiation, off the table, but Israel, for that, would have had to pay more. But with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them? Democrats are doing nothing for DACA, just interested in politics. DACA activists and Hispanics will go hard against Dems, will start falling in love with Republicans and their President! We are about RESULTS. The Failing New York Times has a new publisher, A.G. Sulzberger. Congratulations! Here is a last chance for the Times to fulfill the vision of its Founder, lose all of your phony and non-existent sources, and treat the President of the United States FAIRLY, so that the next time I and the people win, you won't have to write an apology to your readers for a job poorly done! Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation. Good news it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017, the best and safest year on record! Sanctions and other pressures are beginning to have a big impact on North Korea. Soldiers are dangerously fleeing to South Korea. Rocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time. Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not, we will see! Companies are giving big bonuses to their workers because of the Tax Cut Bill. Really great! She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailors pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey & others. Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration. The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food & for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE! The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more! Jobs are kicking in and companies are coming back to the U.S. Unnecessary regulations and high taxes are being dramatically Cut, and it will only get better. MUCH MORE TO COME! I use Social Media not because I like to, but because it is the only way to fight a VERY dishonest and unfair press, now often referred to as Fake News Media. Phony and non-existent sources are being used more often than ever. Many stories & reports a pure fiction! In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year's Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up! Vanity Fair, which looks like it is on its last legs, is bending over backwards in apologizing for the minor hit they took at Crooked H. Anna Wintour, who was all set to be Amb to Court of St James's & a big fundraiser for CH, is beside herself in grief & begging for forgiveness! Based on the fact that the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate has been terminated as part of our Tax Cut Bill, which essentially Repeals over time ObamaCare, the Democrats & Republicans will eventually come together and develop a great new HealthCare plan! The Fake News refuses to talk about how Big and how Strong our BASE is. They show Fake Polls just like they report Fake News. Despite only negative reporting, we are doing well, nobody is going to beat us. Wow, more than 90% of Fake News Media coverage of me is negative, with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories. Hence my use of Social Media, the only way to get the truth out. Much of Mainstream Meadia has become a joke! Despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent, the Democrats have been unable to show any collusion with Russia, so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who I don't know and/or have never met. FAKE NEWS! Another false story, this time in the Failing New York Times, that I watch 4-8 hours of television a day, Wrong! Also, I seldom, if ever, watch CNN or MSNBC, both of which I consider Fake News. I never watch Don Lemon, who I once called the dumbest man on television! Bad Reporting. Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media. They are out of control, correct reporting means nothing to them. Major lies written, then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed… a stain on America! CNN'S slogan is CNN, THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS. Everyone knows this is not true, that this could, in fact, be a fraud on the American Public. There are many outlets that are far more trusted than Fake News CNN. Their slogan should be CNN, THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS! Fake News CNN made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday. They were caught red handed, just like lonely Brian Ross at ABC News who should be immediately fired for his mistake. Watch to see if CNN fires those responsible, or was it just gross incompetence? I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie! Many people in our Country are asking what the Justice Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and acid washed 33,000 Emails? No justice! So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed, while Crooked Hillary Clinton, on that now famous FBI holiday interrogation with no swearing in and no recording, lies many times… and nothing happens to her? Rigged system, or just a double standard?  Oh, thank you very much. Thank you very much. And thank you very much also to a man named Matt Schlapp. What a job he's done. And to CPAC I actually started quite a while ago at CPAC, and came here probably made my first real political speech. And I enjoyed it so much that I came back for a second one, then a third. Then I said, what the hell, let's run for President. Right? But it's wonderful to be back with so many great patriots, old friends, and brave young conservatives. What a future you have. Our movement and our future in our country is unlimited. What we've done together has never been done in the history maybe of beyond of country, maybe in the history of the world. They came from the mountains and the valleys and the cities. They came from all over. And what we did in 2016 the Election, we call it, with a capital E it's never been done before. And we're going to do it, I think, again in 2020, and the numbers are going to be even bigger. And we all had to endure, as I was running. So you had 17 Republicans, plus me. And I was probably more of a conservative than a Republican. People just didn't quite understand that. They didn't understand it. I think now, with what we've done with the judiciary and so many other things, I think they get it very well. And it's driving the other side crazy. But we all had to endure, remember? How many times did you hear, for months and months, There is no way to 270 ? You know what that means, right? There is no way to 270. They couldn't get me there. We might as well have just given up. But there wasn't any way to 270. In fact, I actually went up to Maine to get one, and I did win the one. But we didn't need the one. We didn't need it. We won Maine. We won our half of Maine, remember? You have Nebraska. We won both in Nebraska. We won the half we had to win in Maine. So we got the one, but we didn't need the one, because we didn't get 270; we got 306 to 223. 223-306. A state called Wisconsin, a state called Michigan, where by the way, where Fiat Chrysler just announced a $4.5 billion incredible expansion and new plant, doubling their workforce. Many, many car companies have moved back to Michigan and are continuing to do so. Big numbers. Nobody every thought they'd see that happen. So I think we're going to do even better in 2020. I think we're going to do numbers that people haven't seen for a long time. The men and women here today are on the frontlines of protecting America's interests, defending America's value, and reclaiming our nation's priceless heritage. It's true. With your help, we are reversing decades of blunders and betrayals. These are serious, serious betrayals to our nation and to everything we stand for. It's been done by the failed ruling class that enriched foreign countries at our expense. It wasn't America first. In many cases, it was America last. Those days are over. Long over. America is winning again. America is respected again. And the world knows it. When I meet with prime ministers, when I meet with presidents and I get along with them because they know that what's taken place over many years not just the Obama administration; long before that they can't believe, themselves, that they got away with it. They can't believe it. An impossible thing. And they like me. And the reason they like me they tell me; they say, Mr. President… I said as an example, President Xi of China, I have great respect. We have a great relationship. I say, How is it possible that you got away with this for so long? And he said, Because nobody ever asked us to change. It's true. When they charge 40 percent tariffs on our cars going into China, and we charge them nothing coming into our country; when they raise their tariff from 10 percent to 25 percent and then to 40 percent and they said to me, We expected that somebody would call and say you can't do that. Nobody called, so we just left it. And I don't blame them. We should've been doing the same thing to them. But we didn't. True. Right? Hard to believe. It's hard to believe. But now things are different. Now we're negotiating with China. They wouldn't negotiate with previous administrations. But I found some very old laws from when our country was rich really rich. The old tariff laws we had to dust them off; you could hardly see, they were so dusty. But, fortunately, they weren't terminated. We started getting politically correct, even back then. But I said, when we were doing the great things, what happened to those laws? And I checked, and I found 301 and 382. I found one, 1938, where we can do what we have to do. But, you know, they had a debate in it was really a tough time in our country because we had so much money we didn't know what the hell to do with it. Tough, tough, tough. It was called the Great Tariff Debate. Mark Levin will look this up. And the problem is, with Mark, if I make a little mistake, he'll let us know on Sunday night. I got to be very careful when I talk about this. But it was the Great Tariff Debate of 1888. And the debate was: We didn't know what to do with all of the money we were making. We were so rich. And McKinley, prior to being President, he was very strong on protecting our assets, protecting our country. And he made statements that, Others cannot come into our country and steal our wealth and steal our jobs, and build their country and not defend our country. We can't do that. We can't ever allow that to happen. And, you know I don't know, maybe you know. You know I'm totally off-script, right? AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) Thank you, darling. You know I'm totally off script right now. And this is how I got elected, by being off script. True. And if we don't go off script, our country is in big trouble, folks. Because we have to get it back. And when I look at what's happening on the other side, I encourage it. I say, No, no… I think the New Green Deal, or whatever the hell they call it The Green New Deal, right? Green New Deal I encourage it. I think it's really something that they should promote. They should work hard on. It's something our country needs desperately. They have to go out and get it. But I'll take the other side of that argument only because I'm mandated to. I'm mandated. But they should stay with that argument. Never change. Never change. No planes. No energy. When the wind stops blowing, that's the end of your electric. Let's hurry up. Darling Darling, is the wind blowing today? I'd like to watch television, darling. (Laughter and applause.) No, but it's true. So the Great Tariff Debate of 1888 and then we had so much money we could do whatever we wanted. We built forces up that were incredible. Then, in 1913, they ended tariffs, okay? They ended tariffs. Somebody got stupid and they ended tariffs. They said, Oh, it's okay for other nations to come in. I won't use a certain words because it's not politically but everybody knows the word I'd love to use. Should I use it? I won't do it. Our great First Lady always said, Don't use certain words, please. I said, But the audience wanted me to do it. She said, Don't do it. And the problem is, if I do do that, they won't put the little preamble that we just went through. They'll just use the word, and they'll said, Isn't that terrible. So I won't use it. I've learned. Because with the fake news if you tell a joke, if you're sarcastic, if you're having fun with the audience, if you're on live television with millions of people and 25,000 people in an arena, and if you say something like, Russia, please, if you can, get us Hillary Clinton's emails. Please, Russia, please. Please get us the emails. Please! So everybody is having a good time. I'm laughing, we're all having fun. And then that fake CNN and others say, He asked Russia to go get the emails. Horrible. I mean, I thought like, two weeks ago, I'm watching and they're talking about one of the points. He asked Russia for the emails. These people are sick. And I'm telling you, they know the game. They know the game, and they play it dirty dirtier than anybody has ever played the game. Dirtier than it's ever been played. But the thing that we've done is very special. Because, on trade, and because of tariffs and I know there are people in the Republican Party and people really, even conservatives good conservatives they don't like tariffs. I'm not liking or not liking. The minimum, the greatest negotiating tool in the history of our country. Do you think China would be sending their top representatives over? Right now, China is paying 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of technology goods. I was then going to charge them 25 percent on $200 billion. Not like $200 million that's a lot. This is 200 with a B billion. Two-hundred billion. So but I was nice, because we're having a very strong negotiation, which if it weren't for tariffs and I tell this to President Xi; this is nothing to hide. I would never be talking like this because, in theory, it could hurt your negotiating position. But in my case, it can't, because it's true. I was nice, and I left it at 10 percent on $200 billion. And here's the beauty: We've lost so much money with China $500 billion a year. And on trade, it's such a disaster; it's $507 billion a year. China just one country. We lose with everybody, almost. But China is one country. $507 billion, for many years. So the beauty is this: I have $250 billion more to put tariffs on. The numbers are staggering. Billions of dollars, right now, are pouring into our Treasury. And for those of you that haven't done the research, if you look, of the 25 percent, our country as it's turned out, because it's now been on there for a long while. Our and I'm in no rush because I'm fine with it. I'm fine with it. Of the 25 points, we've paid for 4 points, and China has paid for 21 points. Okay? Twenty-one. That's what the numbers are. It's very simple. You know, everyone said, Oh, it's a tax on our… It's not really. And what China and other countries do sometimes is they will subsidize it. So the tax really is incredible. But what it is, beyond everything else, I can negotiate. But then you have senators and a few congressman, but not Mark Meadows. Where is the great Mark Meadows? He's here someplace. Man, has he been good. Mark and Jim Jordan, and I want to name every one of those couple of hundred people. Because we do have a lot. I want to name every damn one of them. They have been incredible. They've been fighting. And I just see Mark in the audience. They've been fighting with Deb, much more important. His wife is incredible. What an asset. He would be nowhere without her. (Laughter and applause.) Right? But they fight so hard on this witch hunt, this phony deal that they put together; this phony thing that now looks like it's dying. So they don't have anything with Russia. There's no collusion. So now they go and morph into, Let's inspect every deal he's ever done. We're going to go into his finances. We're going to check his deals. We're going to check… These people are sick. They're sick. I saw little Shifty Schiff yesterday. No, it's the first time. He went into a meeting and he said, We're going to look into his finances. I said, Where did that come from? He always talked about Russia collusion with Russia. The collusion delusion. (Laughter and applause.) So now we're waiting for a report, and we'll find out whether or not, and who we're dealing with. We're waiting for a report by people that weren't elected. We had think of this: We had the greatest election in all fairness, I used to hear Andrew Jackson. This was now greater than the election of Andrew Jackson. People say that. No, people say it. I'm not saying it. Right? This was the equivalent or greater. You know, they used to go to Ronald Reagan, when I first started. This is Ronald Reagan. Then we started really doing well, and they were coming from everywhere to vote. Those red hats and white ones. The key is in the color. The key is what it says. Make America Great Again, is what it says. Right? Right? But we had the greatest of all time. Now we have people that lost. And unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions, and they leave people for a long time that shouldn't be there. And, all of a sudden, they're trying to take you out with bullshit. Okay? With bullshit. Now, Robert Mueller never received a vote, and neither did the person that appointed him. And as you know, the Attorney General says, I'm going to recuse myself. I'm going to recuse. And I said, why the hell didn't he tell me that before I put him in? How do you recuse yourself? But the person that appointed Robert Mueller never received a vote. Robert Mueller put 13 of the angriest Democrats in the history of our country on the commission. Now, how do you do that? These are angry, angry people. You take a look at them. One of them was involved with the Hillary Clinton Foundation, running it. Another one has perhaps the worst reputation of any human being I've ever seen. All killers. In fact, it would've been actually better for them if they put half and half, and Mueller can do whatever he wants anyway, which he'll probably do. But we have conflicts. I had a nasty business transaction with Robert Mueller a number of years ago. I said, why isn't that mentioned? He wanted the job as FBI Director. I mean, these are things that are out there; they know it. Why isn't that and I didn't give it to him. Why isn't that mentioned? Jim Comey Lyin' James Comey is his best friend. James Comey is his best friend. And those are a few of the conflicts. Other than that, it's wonderful. So so everybody is waiting. I thought of it this morning, Mark. And I heard you made an incredible speech and statement today. Mark Levin. I heard it was incredible. And I was on the way. But I'll see it later. I guarantee I'll be watching it later. I have one of the great inventions in history. It's called TiVo. I think it's actually better than television, because television is practically useless without TiVo, right? But I'll be watching it later, Mark. But people that got no votes. But I heard this morning, President Trump is waiting for the Mueller report. I said, wait a minute, let me get this straight. So the Attorney General recuses himself, and I don't fire him. No obstruction. That's the other thing: If you use your right, if you use your power, if you use Article 2, it's called obstruction. But only for Trump. For nobody else. So the Attorney General is weak and ineffective, and he doesn't do what he should've done. Somebody that never got a vote writes a powerful letter horrible about Comey. Every single Democrat said Comey should be fired, or worse, if possible. Every Republican said everybody in fact, when I fired Comey, I said, You know… First Lady I said, Melania, I'm doing something today. I'm doing it because it really has to be done. He's bad. He's a bad, bad he's a bad, bad guy. That's been proven now with all of the emails and the texts. I'm doing something that has to be done. But you know the good news? It's going to be bipartisan. It's going to be so popular, it's going to be bipartisan. Every Democrat hates him. Every Republican hates him. He did a horrible job at the FBI. Speak to the real agents, the real people. Because the people in the FBI are incredible people not the sleaze on top. And I said to the First Lady I said, But you know the good news? The good news is that this is going to be so bipartisan. Everyone is going to love it. So we fire Comey. And Schumer who called for his resignation many times Podesta, I believe that day because he still hasn't gotten over getting his ass kicked, okay? I believe that day called for his resignation. That day. Podesta, the great genius of campaigns. He called for the Comey resignation. Others almost every, I would say. Mark, would you say virtually every Democrat, virtually every I can't think of anybody that said he's doing a good job. So I said to Melania, Melania, the good news, this will be a popular thing. And I fire a bad cop. I fire a dirty cop. And all of a sudden, the Democrats say, How dare he fire him. How dare he do this. And that's where we are, folks. That's where we are. We're in this swamp of Washington, D.C. But you know what? We're winning, and they're not. We're winning. So, just to finish and I'll tell you, Matt Schlapp is loving this. He's saying, This is a lot more than we paid for. You know, normally you read a few pages and you say, Bye, folks. But you know what I like about this? Number one, I'm in love, and you're in love. We're all in love together. We've done something that nobody has ever done. Right? It's easy. No, it's easy. You know, a great friend of mine from New York, he's a stone-cold killer. He's a brutal man. He's actually not even a good friend of mine because he'd turn on me in two seconds if it was (inaudible). But he's a very rich guy. And he said, What are you going to speak about today? Like, what are you going to speak? I said, I don't know. I don't know. He said, I just heard that you have the biggest crowd in the history of CPAC. They're all over. By the way, not only in this giant room. They're in many hotel rooms all over the place. You're just better at real estate than they are. (Laughter and applause.) True. But this guy you all know his name very rich guy. And he has a problem with a thing called public speaking. If he has to speak to more than like five people, he chokes. He can't breathe. You know, juh-juh. Are you okay? He kills people for a living meaning mentally and financially but if there's like an audience of nine, it's like augh. So he said to me, How the hell do you do that? And I said, It's easy. And the reason it's easy I really mean this there's so much love in this room, it's easy to talk. You can talk your heart out. You really could. There's love in this room. You can talk your heart out. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy. And we've had that from the day I came down with your First Lady on the escalator in Trump Tower. It's been easy. And you know what? We never had an empty seat. We went out and helped Ted Cruz. We went out and helped so many people. And I'll tell you what: If we didn't do those 32 rallies and it wasn't easy. When you're doing rallies with 25-, 30,000 people in Texas, we had 109,000 people sign up. We used the Houston Rockets arena; it holds 22,000. Tens of thousands were outside. We were sending notices, Please don't come. That's a little different. Usually, people are begging. Well, yeah, like can somebody come? We never had an empty seat. Of course, the Washington Post a guy named David Weigel he wrote an article, some arena No, listen to this. He wrote an article. He got there four hours early. He took pictures of an empty arena. He then put out a note something to the effect, Not very good crowd size, Mr. President. And I never saw it because I don't follow the guy. But thousands of people that were in that arena that was packed with 25,000 people outside that couldn't get in he got there four or five hours early because he doesn't fly private. You know. And maybe it's because of the carbon footprint. You think maybe that's it? Maybe. Must be the carbon footprint. He just doesn't want private. But he got there hours early. And, you know, the place hadn't started taking in people. They weren't going to take them in. So there were virtually nobody. And, you know, whatever it was 18,000 when you have nobody, it's a little scary-looking. So he took pictures. And you know who really got even? Our people. Because they were incensed. We had people sitting on the stairwells. We had people sitting in every seat. I don't think we've had an empty seat since we announced. And from the day we came down the escalator, I really don't believe we've had an empty seat at any arena, at any stadium. It's been an incredible thing. And that's why I say this has never, ever happened before, and now we have to verify it in 2020 with an even bigger victory. And, by the way, just to finish that story, the great Sarah Huckabee and Mercedes, who is incredible, sitting right here Mercedes, thank you. They always say you know, they're good people, right? Much better than I am. They always say, Don't bring it up. Don't fight. Don't fight. Everyone understands. I said, They don't understand. If I don't explain it, how are they going to understand? So remember the arena one, right? And then it was shown. And the Washington Post had to do and this particular writer had to do a I thought he was going to get fired. I mean, if that were a conservative, he would've been fired on the spot. He would've been humiliated for what he did. Because it was fake news. Nobody was in the arena. There were thousands outside but they hadn't opened the gates yet. They did the same thing at our big inauguration speech. You take a look at those crowds. And I watched one of the evening shows that are ridiculous, how horrible they are, how mean how horrible. And I watched it by mistake. And they showed they showed from the White House all the way down. They showed from the Cap- they showed there were people. Nobody has ever seen it. The Capitol down to the Washington Monument people. But I saw pictures that there were no people. Those pictures were taken hours before. Right? And they always mention crowd size. He talks about crowd size. So I'm constantly bugging Mercedes. Whenever we have a slow moment, I say, Mercedes and Sarah show them the pictures. Show them. And compare them with what they put on television. Those pictures were taken hours before. And remember this also not that Obama would ever do this: But we had fencing all the way down to the Washington Monument. And it was raining and it was wet, and the grass was wet. And women and men and I consider them totally equal, so I'm not going to say it's harder. In fact, it's probably, with the men I know, it's actually easier for the women to make the walk, right? But they had to walk all the way down. They had to walk with high heels, in many cases. They had to walk all the way down to the Washington Monument and then back. And I looked, and I made a speech, and I said, before I got on I said to the people that were sitting next to me, I've never seen anything like this. Look at that crowd. And it was wide. Wide. We had a crowd I've never seen anything like it. And I have to live I have to live with crowd size. It's all a phony deal. But I saw a picture just the other night of practically no people. It was taken hours before our great day. That was a great day for us. That was a great, great day. People came from all over. People came from all over. So, Sarah said, and Mercedes said, Sir, it doesn't matter. Nobody cares. I said, But I care. And people care. People care. So what I'm going to do is I'll give it to the great one. I'll give it to Mark Levin. And I'll give him the picture. Then I'll show you where they showed, just the other day, an empty field like nobody on it. And you'll see the sun. You know, you can see it's very dark, because the sun is like starting to rise, right? And you can have some fun. You're going to get big ratings on your show, I'll tell you that. Sunday night, everybody. Sunday night. Huh? Ten o'clock, right? Sunday night at 10 o'clock. AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) (Laughs.) Thank you. I knew that, actually. But thank you. All right, now let's get back to what I'm here for. And don't fall asleep. Don't fall asleep, right? Don't fall asleep. You know, somebody said, Oh, the speech you made, sir, the State of the Union speech was incredible. They said it was incredible. They said that was so great. And I said I said I did; I got great reviews, even from some of the really bad ones out there. Of course, by the following morning, they had to change because the head people called up, What are you doing? A lot of it is not the people on television, you know. A lot of it is their bosses which someday we're going to have to figure out why, Meadows, why that is. Because, you know, if you're building a great country, you have the best employment and unemployment numbers we've ever had. More people are working today in the United States than ever before in the history of our country. And you say, why are they upset by that? Why? Why are they upset by that? We've slashed 30,000 pages of job-killing regulations from the Federal Register. That's an all-time record in the history of the United States, even by Presidents there for eight years, and in one case more. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. And we got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big deal. Which should lead to the ending of the disaster known as Obamacare. It should. The great state of Texas has a case, and it was literally based on the individual mandate. Now that it's gone, I don't know how they rule against it. Now we'll have to find out. But that'll soon be up in the Supreme Court of the United States, I hope. And we're going to see what happens. And then we're going to get together with the Democrats and come up with really great healthcare, okay? Really great healthcare. And of the other things we did in our tax package is ANWR. Perhaps the largest field in the world oil and gas. I got it approved. And I didn't want to get it approved for a certain reason, because I thought somebody treated me very badly. Very badly. Don't get that vote very often. And I said, you know, I don't want to get it. Then I get a call from a friend of mine, and he's in the oil business. He's not asking for anything. He said but he really is a knowledgeable guy when it comes to oil and gas. He said to me, Hey and they all call me Mr. President. I have friends that, for 35 years, Hey, Don, how you doing? Hey, Donny. I love you, Donny. For 35 years. Now they call, Mr. President, sir. How are you? I have a friend a very rich guy Richard LeFrak, in New York. A builder. A good builder. He calls me all my life, Hey, Don, how you doing? I've known this guy so long from kindergarten. It's true. Hi, Don, how you doing? How's everything? And now I get a call the other day, Mr. President, how are you, sir? How are you? I said, Richard, lighten up. Lighten up. Call me ‘Donald'. Richard, call me ‘Donald'. You've known me for I don't want to say, because I don't want my wife to hear the number. But it's true. Actually, that's true. That's actually true. Richard came up; he said, I've known your husband for 65 years. I said, Don't say that. I say, Say 25, 30. Don't say 65 years. But I said, Richard Richard, call me ‘Donald', like you always do. Call me ‘Don'. Okay. Okay, Don. Okay. He gets his breath. Uh-huh. Two minutes later Mr. President… That's called respect for the office, right? Maybe that's a good thing, right? Many many of my friends. And that wasn't in the script either, Mark. But we're renegotiating, right now, horrible trade deals that we're cracking down and we are really doing a number cracking down on countries that cheat, and standing up for the American worker for the first time in many, many decades. Many decades. Our workers have been treated horribly. A country announces they're closing their plant in Michigan or Pennsylvania or Ohio they're closing. They're closing a plant; they're going to move to Mexico. They're going to move to China. They're going to move someplace else. They fire all their workers. And then they sell their cars, no tax; just make them in Mexico, sell them back to here. No tax, no nothing. Those days are all gone, folks. They're all gone. They're all gone. And in the new deal with Mexico and Canada, called the USMCA, it's very, very hard prohibitively hard for a company to fire its 4,000 workers and move to Mexico or some other location. It's now a very costly they can do it, I guess, if they want. But it's costly. It's painful. It used to be almost I said I used to I've been talking about this for a long time. I used to say it's almost like we're giving them an incentive to leave our country. Again, I'm for America first. That wasn't for America first. And we have great companies that are now moving back to our country. They're coming back in. They're coming back in. And, by the way, you know I'm building the wall. We're finishing the wall. We got a lot of money. It's in the thing. But and there will be some people in the room that don't like this. We're down to 3.7 percent unemployment the lowest number in a long time. But think of this: I got all these companies moving in. They need workers. We have to bring people into our country to work these great plants that are opening up all over the place. This was not necessarily what I was saying during the campaign because I never knew we would be as successful as we've been. Companies are roaring back into our country, and now we want people to come in. We need workers to come in, but they've got to come in legally, and they've got to come in through merit, merit, merit. They've got to come in through merit. They have to be people that can help us. They have to be people that can love our country, not hate our country. We have people in Congress right now, we have people in Congress that hate our country. And you know that. And we can name every one of them if they want. They hate our country. It's sad. It's very sad. When I see some of the things being made, the statements being made, it's very, very sad. Very, very and find out, how did they do in their country? Just ask them, how did they do? Did they do well? Were they succeeding? Just ask that question. Somebody would say, Oh, that's terrible that he brings that up. But that's okay, I don't mind. I'll bring it up. How did they do in their country? Not so good. Not so good. But we need workers. We have to bring in workers. One other thing because we have a lot of people here that are important people in terms of votes. We have some senators. We have some congressmen. When a senator tells us that he's a free trader, so am I. I'm a fair trader. I'm a free trader. But when a senator said we can't do tariffs, where we make a fortune, or at a minimum, we're able to use this tremendous power that I found tremendous old stuff. Nobody even knew it existed. I'm able to use it, at a minimum, to negotiate great and fair trade deals. They wouldn't even be talking to us because it's so one-sided. Last year, we lost eight hundred this for many years almost $800 billion on trade. It's not sustainable. You can't do that. And now we're making great trade deals. But when some of the senators good people; I think they're good people. I just don't understand the thinking. So I say, India is a very high-tariff nation. They charge us a lot. When we send a motorcycle to India, it's 100 percent tariff. They charge 100 percent. When India sends a motorcycle to us, we brilliantly charge them nothing. So I want a reciprocal tax, or at least I want to charge a tax. It's called a mirror tax, but it's a reciprocal tax. Now, here's what I don't understand: I've had a lot of people Lindsey Graham. I said, Lindsey it's not his thing necessarily. It's not the thing that he's most adept at. But he's adept and he's smart. I said, Lindsey, if they charge us a hundred, I'd like a reci-… If they charge us, we charge them. He goes, That makes sense to me. And then he gets on to judiciary and things that, frankly, he likes and finds very interesting. But he's a smart guy, and he said I'll never forget. It took me about a minute, which is a long time. I did a bad description. It's so easy. They charge 100; we charge nothing. Now we have reciprocal, so it's 100. But what happens now, for those that really think about tariffs and don't like tariffs for whatever reason might be and that's okay. What's going to happen is, in many cases, instead of 100 and 100, you're going to have zero and zero, so you won't have any tariff. Okay? It's going to happen. That's going to happen. But you have to you have to start working on some of the senators that say I can't approve this deal. I say, You know what? I want to just charge India as an example, I'm using it. But India is a very high-tariff nation. I mean, nobody nobody knows it because nobody knows what they're doing in Washington. But India is a very, very high-tariff nation, and they charge tremendous tremendous numbers. So they charge 100. So I say, I'm not going to charge 100, but I'm going to charge 25 percent. And I hear this turmoil in the Senate because we're charging 25. So I call a couple of the guys up. I say, Fellas, listen, they're charging us 100 for the exact same product. I want to charge them 25. And I feel so foolish charging 25 because it should be 100. But I'm doing 25 only because of you. I want to get your support. Sir, that's not free trade. Where do these people come from? Where do they come from? Where? Where do they come from? I need your help. I need your help the voters' help. Where do they come from? So it can only be one of two or three things. Number one, I know they're very smart people. I know they are. And I even like some of them. But they're smart. So we take that out of the equation. So even and I know they don't have evil intentions. And the other thing could be, I guess, maybe you know, these companies are all owned by people, and these people are very generous. Campaign contributions they're very, very generous people. Can that be possible? I don't think so. I hope not. Because we're talking about our country. We can't allow a country to charge 100 percent and we get nothing for the same exact product. For one thing, they don't respect us. They think we're stupido. They don't respect us. But let me tell you something: The world respects our country again. They respect us. And America is now booming like never before. Other countries are doing very poorly. Other countries are doing very poorly, and that makes it even harder for us to be successful. Plus, we have a gentleman that likes raising interest rates in the Fed. We have a gentleman that loves quantitative tightening in the Fed. We have a gentleman that likes a very strong dollar in the Fed. So with all of those things and we want a strong dollar, but let's be reasonable. You understand that. With all of that, we're doing great. Can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were? There's no inflation, essentially. There's no inflation. Can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were? If we didn't do quantitative tightening, taking money out of the market? If we didn't do quantitative and this would lead to a little bit lower dollar. A little bit. I want a strong dollar, but I want a dollar that's going to be great for our country, not a dollar that's so strong that it is prohibitive for us to be dealing with other nations and taking their business. Since the election, we've created a number that if I would have said during the campaign, the fake news just back there would have said this is crazy. 5.3 million new jobs, including over, now, 600,000 beautiful, brand-new manufacturing jobs that were never going to come back to our country. These are jobs that were never coming back to our country. Remember? Not to talk badly about the other administration, but if that theory went forward with Crooked Hillary winning the election, instead of being up almost 50 percent with the stock market, you would have been down 50 percent. It was heading down. It was going to be a disaster. We have nearly 5 million Americans that have been lifted off of food stamps. Nobody ever thought that was possible. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest in over 51 years. And African American and you've heard me say this many times Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates are at their all-time historic lows. And African American income has reached an all-time high. So when I'm on the debate stage with one of these maniacs I mean, trains to Hawaii. How do you get to Europe? We haven't figured that one out yet. We don't use airplanes anymore. You saw what I'm doing in California, right? They have a fast train. The fast train goes from San Francisco to Los Angeles. It's over budget by hundreds of billions of dollars, so they have a great idea the new governor; nice guy. Yeah, he's a nice guy. When I'm with him face to face, nice. When he speaks about me, not so nice. But face to face, he loves me. He called me up. He said, You're a great President. You're doing a great job. He actually did, two weeks ago, three weeks. So he'll probably deny it, but check the phone records at the White House. Everybody else does. Check them. Check them. Check them. Called me up three or four weeks ago. I think they need some forest money, because honestly, the management of the forests is very bad and that's one of the problems they have. I said, You got to get those forests. We can't keep spending billions and billions and losing hundreds of lives, more importantly. Got to clean it up. It's called management. When a tree falls, you can't let the environmentalist say you can't take that tree out. It becomes like a matchstick, that tree. It hits a flame, it goes up. The leaves every once in a while, you have to remove the leaves because they are so a guy smoking a cigarette, he throws it away, he doesn't mean it. The thing catches on fire and we lose 400,000 acres and people are killed. You got to have management. But he called me up the other day, recently let's say four weeks ago or so. He said, I just want to tell you you're a great President and you're one of the smartest people I've ever met. That's what he said. Now, that's what he said. Will he admit it? No, I doubt it. But that's what he said. And you're doing a great job. And then he did start talking about, in all fairness, additional money for the fire, which is it's okay. That's okay. We have great talks. I mean, I like him. Gavin Newsom. I like him. Nice guy. But they say things you know, politicians, they say things to your face, and then you see two days later they're giving a news conference just like, where did that guy come from? Where did he come from? But everyone in this great country, right now, because of our great new economy, is doing well except, of course, for the Never Trumpers. But they are on mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. (Laughter and applause.) Mouth to mouth. Mouth to mouth. They're hanging in. A couple of them. I mean, these guys have gotten me wrong. Not only Never Trumpers. You have Never Trumpers; you have certain hardline. They're basically dishonest people because, look, let's face it: Whether you like me or not if my name is Smith instead of Trump, and if you told him I put in over 100 federal judges it'll soon be 145 federal judges and 2 Supreme Court judges. And 17 appellate division judges. That we've got the best economy maybe in our history. That we've got the best employment numbers and unemployment numbers in our history. That we've cut more regulations in two years than any President has ever done, whether it's for eight or beyond. That we've taken care of our military with $1.7 billion. Think of that. Think of what we did. Think of what we did with our military. Think of the numbers that we have for our military. We have numbers nobody has ever heard of these numbers before. And you know, part of the problem that we have because I'm a cost cutter. But and you are all cost cutters. But we have to take care of our military. We have to. Seven hundred billions dollars we spent. And that was the first year. And then the second year, $716 billion. Now, I have no choice. I'd like to spend much less. Obama was spending much less but our military was being depleted. He was fighting in endless wars; they'd never end. And, by the way, as of probably today or tomorrow, we will actually have 100 percent of the caliphate in Syria. One hundred percent. One hundred percent. And we'll leave a small group of guys and gals. But we want to bring our people back home. We want to bring our people back home. It's time. Been in these wars. We were going to be in Syria for four months. We ended up five years. This fighting they just like to fight. We want to fix our country. We want to fix our bridges, our highways, our roads, our schools. We want to fix our country up. It's time. It's time. But I was told by a general, who I had to fire I said, General, how long before we get 100 percent of the caliphate? He said, Sir, two years. I said, I can't take it two years. And then I flew to Iraq; first time I left the White House because I stayed in the White House for months and months because I wanted the Democrats to get back from their vacations from Hawaii and these other places. And I figured it would look good if I stayed in the White House so that you people all love me and vote for me, okay? I figured it would look good. (Laughter and applause.) I figured it would look good. So I stayed in the White House. And I'll tell you what: I was there I told my wife, Go to Florida. Enjoy your Christmas. I stayed for Thanksgiving. I said I mean, I was in the White House for a long time. Months. Months. I had cabin fever in the White House. But if you've got to have cabin fever, that's the place to do it, okay? But I was there, I don't know, for a number of months, through Christmas. I spent my New Year's all by myself. Don't cry. All it was me and about 500 men and women outside with machine guns. I never saw so many beautiful-looking machine guns. I'd look at that equipment and I'd say, Man… They sit in the trees. They sit on the lawn. I told people, I'm in this mess you know, people don't know how big the White House. First of all, it's one of the most beautiful places in the world. It's really I made a lot of money with luxury. This building is 1799 which, of course, when President Xi comes, I say 1799, like it's old. To him, that's like a brand-new house in China. In China, they go back they go back 8,000 years. So that's that's like a new that's like a new residence. But I sat in the White House for months and months, except I took a day off. I flew to a lovely place called Iraq, and I flew at night and I got there at night. And I said to myself, this is interesting, because they say, Sir, all of the lights in the plane, sir, are going off. I say, Why? Because we're getting ready to land. We're an hour out. I said, What about the shades? Well, we want it better than that. May be like (inaudible). So we turned the lights off, put the shades down. This is a big seven forty Air Force One. And we're landing, and I go up and I look. And I've landed; I like to sit with pilots. I respect people that know what they're doing, and these are the best in the world. I really do. These are the best in the world. And the pilot says, Sir, we're landing in approximately one and a half minutes. I say, But there's no runway. No, sir, the runway is right up there, sir. I say, I don't see it. I have pretty good vision. At least for my age I have good vision. I guess for my age I have great vision. But I don't have vision like a 35-year-old captain. He said, No, it's right up there. I said, I'm sorry, Captain, how about this: Should we lift off and try it again? Captain, there's no runway. Anyway he sits right up there and we land. There's practically not lights. These are little pin spots. And I said, think of this: We spent $7 trillion in the Middle East and we can't land with the lights on 20 years later. How bad is it? No, seriously, how bad is it? How bad is it? Seven trillion dollars and we have to fly in with no lights. But I met some incredible people. I met some incredible people generals. One of them came from Syria the operation in Syria. And I was upset with my generals because they weren't getting it finished. I want the job done. I want to bring our people back home. It's not fair. And this is why I flew. So I met generals I didn't know. General one, general two, general three. I mean, these generals there's no person in Hollywood that could play the role. These guys are like perfect people. I said, What's your name? Sir, my name is Raisin. What the hell kind of a name? I said, Raisin, like the fruit? He goes, Yes, sir, Raisin. What's your last name? Caine. Raisin Caine. I said, You got to be kidding me. It's true. Raisin Caine. I just made him a big star. Just like I did with Mattis when I said, We're going to give you a new nickname, because ‘Chaos' is not a good nickname. So we changed his name. Called him Mad Dog. But it wasn't working too well. Mad Dog wasn't working too well. So what happened is I flew to Iraq. I wanted to meet the people on the site, because I learn more sometimes from soldiers, what's going on, than I do from generals. I do. I hate to say it. And I tell that to the generals all the time. But I didn't have to go there. I didn't have to go there. Because I meet and I land in this airport, the most incredible thing. We must have spent $3 billion building it. It's one of the reasons I don't want to leave Iraq so fast. I said, Well, how do we leave this thing? So I have Raisin Caine and three other generals, colonels, sergeants. And I said, Bring the cameras. I'm going to make a movie. This is the most incredible thing. And I said to the generals, Listen, we got to get out. I want to know why is it going to take two years to knock off 2 or 3 or 4 percent, which is what we had left. It won't, sir. And I said, Tell me why it won't. It won't, sir. If we attack them in a different manner, we can do it much faster. Okay, General Raisin Caine, how fast can Sir, we can have it totally finished in one week. I said, One week? I was told two years. One week? That's right, sir. We're only hitting them from a temporary base in Syria. But if you gave us permission, we could hit them from the back, from the side, from all over from the base that you're right on, right now, sir. They won't know what the hell hit them. They won't know what the hell hit them, sir. And I said, Why didn't my other generals tell me that? Why didn't they tell me that? I said, Did you tell them that? Not our place to say it, sir. They come in from Washington, sir. We have to take orders. You're the first one to ask us our opinion. It's true. It's true. True. True. So I went back and I said, I'm going to get back to you soon, Raisin. I think you're great. I like you, Raisin Caine. But I did say I said, Well, hey, listen, we're in Iraq. Isn't that very far away from… I was here in a very short time, sir. I flew right in. Of course, he's taking a plane that goes 2,000 miles an hour, you know. But incredible. What you learn from being on the site my father was a builder. He always used to say, Nobody ever got rich by sitting behind their desk. It's true. It's true. He'd say, You got to be on this site. You got to be with the contractors. You got to see if they're ripping you off. You've got to collect every nail that's dropped, every piece of wood. You can sell it. You got to be on the site. You got to see while they're building, while they're under construction, is that wall straight or if it's crooked. And you have to fix it before they build it, not after they build it, when you rip everything down. True. You don't get rich by sitting behind a desk. So I didn't want to do that. And I'm in the White House and I was lonely. I said, Let's go to Iraq. And I had a hell of a meeting in Iraq. And I'll tell you, those generals not just Raisin Caine, General Caine. Those generals were great. They were great. They knew their stuff. They were gung-ho. And it is true I mean, you talk central casting. These guys you couldn't I mean, it's incredible. They had a master sergeant. I could take him right now, bring him to Hollywood, make a military movie, and he's the star of the movie. That happened once before, you know. That did happen once before. Remember? They brought a man in a sergeant, a drill sergeant to teach some actor how to be a drill sergeant. The drill sergeant was so incredible that he ended up starring in the movie, and he should have gotten the Academy Award, by the way, but he didn't. That's because Hollywood discriminates against our people. You know the movie I'm talking about, right? What was that movie? You know the movie. But while we're making great strides, and our country is doing as well and maybe, in many ways, better than it's ever done before Democrat lawmakers are now embracing socialism. They want to replace individual rights with total government domination. Just this week, more than 100 Democrats in Congress signed up for a socialist takeover of American healthcare. Their radical government-run plan if you call it that would lead to colossal tax increases increases like you've never seen before and take away private coverage from over 180 million Americans. And we have some great private coverage, and we've initiated some incredible plans, like the new cooperative plan, where you get better insurance than Obamacare for a fraction of the cost. But perhaps nothing is more extreme than the Democrats' plan to completely takeover American energy and completely destroy America's economy through their new $100 trillion Green New Deal. Under the Green New Deal which somebody described as a high school term paper written by a poor student (laughter and applause) it's true. It's true. Who would believe it? It so it's so bad. But I don't I'll be honest with you, folks. I said you know, it's Saturday morning, and I said, Matt, should we do a little more, like, spend time? He said, Yeah, would you do that? By the way, everybody okay? I haven't seen anybody leaving. I haven't seen anybody. I know one thing: If Mark Levin gets up and leaves, I'll finish very quickly, because then I know. But I haven't seen anyone leaving. Nobody has left. I watch those doors. Because a lot of times a lot of times well, one time, the press said people left. Yeah, you know where they went? To the bathroom. And then they came back. Two people. They showed two empty seats in a stadium of 19,000. They showed two empty seats. The people left right in front of me, and I said, Oh, man, maybe this isn't a good job I'm doing. Then they came back. They went to the bathroom. And a certain fake news deal showed a picture on the front page of these two empty seats. They said Trump had empty seats. We never have empty seats. The Green New Deal would completely abolish the American oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear power industries, of which we're now the leader in the world. We're the biggest now in the world because of moves that I've made. Happened over the last two years, by the way. And we're trying to speed up pipelines in Texas, which would have taken 15 years. We think we're almost very close to getting them approved. When that happens, we'll go probably another 30 to 40 percent. We need pipeline approval. We're going to have it very quickly. It would have taken it was going to be a 14 to 15 year process. We should have it done. We'll pick up 30 to 40 percent more. Their plan would remove every gas-powered car from American roads. Oh, that's not so bad. They want you to have one car instead of two, and it should be electric, okay? So tell people, no more cars. No more cars. I think the auto industry is not going to do too well under this plan. What do you think, Meadows? How is this? Will the auto industry be good? I don't think so. It's not looking good. I think maybe maybe you're going to see some bad stock prices if that passes. It would end air travel. But you'll get on a train, don't worry about it. You just have to cross off about 95 percent of the world. And it would force the destruction or renovation of virtually every existing structure in the United States. New York City would have to rip down buildings and rebuild them again. I don't think so. This is the craziest plan, and yet I see senators that are there for 20 years white hair. See, I don't have white hair. (Laughter and applause.) I don't have white hair. No, I see these white-haired, longtime senators standing behind this young woman, and she's ranting and raving like a lunatic. And these senators these senators: Yes, I agree with this. Yes, I agree. The crazy female senator from the state of Ohio, the state of Hawaii. Right? She's like she's like a crazed person. What she said about men is so bad. What she said about men is so bad. But she's standing in the hallway. And she didn't know too much about the plan because she's you know, she can't understand that plan. Which probably makes her smart, actually. Now, this is the senator from Hawaii, and they're saying to her, What do you think? Well, I don't know how people are going to get to Hawaii, but I'm in favor of the plan. (Laughter and applause.) I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. So she's in favor of the plan, but you won't be able to get to well, we can take boats, I guess. We'll go back to boats. This is the new Democrat platform for the and I don't want to talk them out of it. I don't. I don't. I swear I don't. This is a killer. I got to get off this subject. I want them to embrace this plan. I want them to go and sell this plan. I just want to be the Republican that runs against them for that. I'm going to regret this speech. This speech should have been delivered one year from now, not now, damn it. Because they're going to grab out together, and they're going to say, You know, this guy is really laying for us. I should've saved the Pocahontas thing for another year. Because I've destroyed her political career, and now I won't get a chance to run against her, and I would've loved it. We got to you know, I don't want to knock out all of the good stuff and end up with somebody that's actually got talent. That would be terrible. (Laughter and applause.) So I do like the Green New Deal. I respect it greatly. It should be part of the dialogue of the next election. (Laughter and applause.) And I think it has tremendous promise and tremendous potential for the future of our country. Socialism is not about the environment. It's not about justice. It's not about virtue. Socialism is about only one thing. It's called power for the ruling class. That's what it is. Look at what's happening in Venezuela and so many other places. All of us are here today because we know that the future does not belong to those who believe in socialism. And I heard, yesterday, a great speech from our Vice President Mike Pence, talking about this very subject and talking about it beautifully. The future belongs to those who believe in freedom. I have said it before and I'll say it again: America will never be a socialist country ever. Young Americans I love young Americans. Speaking of young Americans Candace, stand up. Candace is getting married. Stand up. You've been incredible. Thank you. Your whole group has been great. You're getting married. Seems like a nice guy to me. Congratulations. You've been so great. Thank you very much, Candace. Thanks. And, Charlie, what a job you're doing. Where's Charlie? Where's Charlie? Where is Charlie Kirk? Because he has done an incredible job. Thank you very much, Charlie. But young Americans like you are leading the revival of American liberty, sovereignty, and self-determination in the face of left-wing intolerance. The anger the unbelievable anger I see it every day. Fortunately, for you, it's mostly pointed at me. You have the courage to speak the truth, to do what is right, and to fight for what you believe, and keep doing it. We reject oppressive speech codes, censorship, political correctness, and every other attempt by the hard left to stop people from challenging ridiculous and dangerous ideas. These ideas are dangerous. Instead, we believe in free speech, including online and including on campus. And, by the way, there's a young gentleman with us today. There's a young gentleman. I turned on my television the other day, and I saw somebody that was violently punched in the face. Violently punched. And I said that's disgusting. By a bully I'd like to do a lot of things. But, of course, we would never do that. Because if I ever said violence, they would say, Donald Trump attacked. No, no, no. Just for the media: I'm sure he's a lovely young man; just had a little temper tantrum. I've been there before with those people. I don't want to do it again. So, the man's name is Hayden Williams. Where's Hayden? Where is he? Where is he? Hayden, come up here. Come up here. WILLIAMS: Thank you. Thank you. So, at the Leadership Institute, we're committed to making campuses great again. And I thank you so much for bringing me up here to let me speak. It's great it's great that I'm being recognized, and but there's so many conservative students across the country who are facing discrimination, harassment, and worse, if they dare to speak up on campus. So I'm glad that we could we could, you know, bring this to the forefront. And I'd just like to say, you know, if these socialist progressives had their way, they would put our Constitution through the paper shredder in a heartbeat. So, you know, it's as important now than ever the work at Leadership Institute and Campus Reform you know, exposing these liberal abuses to the public it's as important now as ever. And these students these students do it because they have a love of our nation and freedom, and frankly, a love for you, Mr. President. So if you keep defending us, we'll keep defending you. Thank you. WILLIAMS: Thank you. Stay here for a second. So, here's the one thing. I was going to call him, but I don't have to now. I see him here. But here's the one thing: I learned a number of things. First of all, he can take a punch. If Muhammad Ali could take a punch, he can take a punch. Because you weren't going to go down no matter how that was a hell of a hard punch. He was a strong guy. But you know what? You've got yourself a great lawyer. I know your lawyer. She is a great lawyer. Just tell her to do me a favor: Sue him. But he's probably got nothing, but sue him forever. But sue the college, the university. And maybe sue the state. Ladies and gentlemen, he took a hard punch in the face for all of us. Remember that. He took a punch for all of us. And we can never allow that to happen. And here is, in closing with Hayden here's the good news: He is going to be a very wealthy young man. That's okay. (Laughter and applause.) Go get 'em, Hayden. Today I'm proud to announce that I will be very soon signing an executive order requiring colleges and universities to support free speech if they want federal research dollars. If they want our dollars, and we give it to them by the billions, they've got to allow people like Hayden and many other great young people, and old people, to speak. Free speech. And if they don't, it will be very costly. That'll be signed very soon. Every day, we're restoring common sense and the timeless values that unite us all. We believe in the Constitution and the rule of law. We believe in the First Amendment right. And we believe in religious liberty. And we believe strongly in the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms which is under siege, folks. They have a lot of plans. It's under siege. Be careful. But I'll protect you, I promise you that. I'll protect you. Because it all has to come through my office. And we hopefully are going to be here for six more years, so you're in good shape. We believe in the American Dream, not in the socialist nightmare. And we believe in the words of our national motto: In God We Trust. Every day, my presidency will defend American families. We will defend America's workers our great, great cherished workers that now we're taking care of. They're not losing their jobs. We're creating those jobs. We're not letting those companies destroy their lives anymore. We will defend the American way of life, and we will always defend America's borders. Because without borders, as I've said many times before, we don't have a country. The lawless chaos on our southern border provides a lucrative cash flow to some of the most dangerous criminal organizations on the planet. Deadly cartels constantly daily, hourly violate our borders to flood our cities with drugs that kill thousands and thousands of our citizens violently. What are these people talking about when they talk about the border? Keep it open. Keep what open? Have you been there? Have you seen? I just got back. I've been there many times. I see what's happening. I don't like it. But I have to tell you, our Border Patrol, our ICE agents, our law enforcement, the job they do and they don't have the backup of a wall, in many cases the job they do is incredible. These ruthless cartels terrorize innocent communities on both sides of the border and spread instability throughout our hemisphere. When I was there two weeks ago, 26 people were killed very close to where I was, on the Rio Grande. Sounds nice, right? The Rio Grande. Rough. Rough stuff. Twenty-six people were killed, and they were buried right near where I was standing. And the paper doesn't write about it. The news doesn't write about it. In the last two years alone, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests. Think of what that means. Think of that arrests. I'm not talking about people coming in. I'm talking they went out and arrested 266,000 people who have criminal records and, in some cases, for murder. Who the hell wants to do that? Thank God they're doing it because I don't want to do it. It's dangerous. It's hard. But they love our country, and they're tough people, but they love our country. Including those charged or convicted of approximately 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, 25,000 burglaries, 4,000 kidnappings, and 4,000 violent murders. These are people that ICE is going in and getting, and either putting in jail or ideally bringing them back to other countries and letting them put in jail, because we don't want them. We don't want to have to pay for them for 50 years. You want them to pay a price, but we don't want to have to pay for them for 50 years. And all the nonsense you hear about the people that come in illegally are far better than the people we have it's not true, folks. Okay? It's false. It's false propaganda. Right? One recent study from FAIR F-A-I-R found that illegal aliens are incarcerated at three times the rate of legal residents. Those are the numbers. And if you look at prison population in federal prisons, these federal prisons are the number is staggering. The number of illegals far, far, far greater than any proportion of our population. But you don't hear that; you hear like these people are the greatest people in the world. Just ask the Angel Moms how good are there. Those great Angel Moms who were treated so badly so badly. Incredible people. But the simple reality is that every crime committed by an illegal immigrant is a crime that should never have happened in the first place. The border crisis is also a heartbreaking humanitarian tragedy. Vicious coyotes, smugglers, and human traffickers prey upon innocent women and children. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the dangerous journey north. When I ran for president, my first speech, I mentioned the word rape. The press went after me; I couldn't believe it. I said, Will it be like this always? The answer was yes. It even got worse. From day one, I mention the word rape. If you look at that speech, that was so innocent compared to what's really happening. That was a very innocent speech compared to the real facts. Illegal immigration is not compassionate. It's inhumane, unjust, and cruel. The media fights me on this, but I say it: Mothers who love their daughters, when their daughters are getting ready to make that 2,000-mile trek up through Mexico and frankly, I wish Mexico would stop them at their northern border, at our I wish Mexico would stop them. Because you know, they have a border. They call it their southern border. It's 2,000 miles down from our southern border. I wish Mexico would stop them. But they have their own difficulties. Frankly, I understand that. We're working along well with them. And they are doing a lot of things to help us with asylum and other elements of what we're doing. But mothers, who love their daughters, give them massive amounts of birth control pills because they know their daughters are going to be raped on the way up to our southern border. Think of that. True story, told to me by the Border Patrol. So true and so sad. Think of how evil that is. Think of how bad it is. Those caravans you look at those caravans, and some are phenomenal people. But in those caravans you have stone-cold killers. You had the interview done by some innocent person who I think is actually back there now. And what is it that you want asylum for? Why are you coming to America? Uh, murder. She goes, What? Murder. I mean, what's going on is incredible. And when those caravans are formed, do you think those countries that we used to give a lot of money to I've cut it way back. I've cut it way back. Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. Do you think they're giving us, as we say, their best and their finest? Oh, let's send our best people up to America. Let's have our best people go in the caravan so we can give America our greatest people. No, no, no, no. They give us some very bad people. People with big, long crime records. People with tremendous violence in their past. Murderers, killers, drug dealers, human traffickers. They want to keep their good people because they're smart. It's so sad to see how stupid we've been. Border Patrol recently reported apprehending 7,000 unlawful migrants in a single week on just one part of the Texas border, a couple of weeks ago. Our immigration system is stretched far beyond the breaking point. To confront this national security crisis, last month I declared a national emergency. A national emergency. And when I see these people and they're good people some senators, mostly I tell you, the House has been fantastic. The House you know, backing we've had from the House has really been I'm talking about in the last short period of time. There's a lot of spirit in the House, and I think in the Senate too, but we're going to have to see because we have a vote coming up. And a lot of people talk about precedent. Precedent. That if we do this, the Democrats will use national emergency powers for something that we don't want. They're going to do that anyway, folks. The best way to stop that is to make sure that I win the election. That's the best way to stop that. They're going to do it anyway. They'll do it anyway. I watch good people, they're friends of mine, We're very concerned with setting precedent. That's precedent not president. Precedent. We're very concerned about setting precedent. I'm very concerned with having murderers and drug traffickers, and drugs and drug cartels, pouring into our country. That's what I'm concerned about. And the Democrats, they're going to do whatever they do if they get into power, and it won't have a damn thing to do with whether or not we approve our national emergency. Because let me tell you they don't like it when I say it but we are being invaded. We're being invaded by drugs, by people, by criminals. And we have to stop it. And we want people to come in, as I said before, but they have to come in legally and with merit. Previous presidents have used their national emergency power to promote democratic elections in Belarus, to ensure political stability in Burundi, and to defend the sovereignty of Lebanon. And you know what? That's okay. In Lebanon it's good. Fine. Use it. But we need it right here in our country. We have to use it for our country. Many emergency declarations have been used to protect people in faraway nations and distant lands. Now we are protecting, finally, our people. You. Our people. And we are proudly standing with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement. Illegal immigration is also deeply unfair to American workers and taxpayers, including millions and millions of hardworking legal immigrants. If you care about helping immigrants and care about their success, if you care about reducing poverty and raising living standards, then you must support a safe, strong, and very, very secure border. We need an immigration policy that helps all Americans thrive, flourish, prosper. We need an immigration policy that's going to be great for our corporations and our great companies. We need an immigration policy where people coming into our country can love our country and love our fellow citizens. And this includes shutting down sanctuary cities. And we want to end catch-and-release. We catch them, we realize they're a criminal, and we have to release them. Think of this: They come onto our land, they put one foot on our land. We now have to take them through a massive court trial. Who does this? Other countries say, Get the hell out of here. We have to take them through court. So we catch them. We talk to them. If they're criminals, or if they're not, we release them. We say, Come back for a hearing in front of a judge. You know how many judges you need to do this? We have 900,000 people backlogged. That's the good news. The bad news? Nobody shows up. Three percent of the people come back for a trial. It's insane. Not my fault I inherited this mess, but we're fixing it. We have to end chain migration, and we have to cancel the visa lottery. Every American, no matter where they're born, will benefit from the creation of a lawful immigration system. It is such you talk about an emergency. Our immigration system is so broken, folks. It's so broken. It's so sad to see. It's incompetent. It's laughed at all over the world. We have people pouring in from not just the southern border in Mexico. From China. They have a baby on our land. The baby becomes a citizen. Welcome to the United States for hopefully 90 years. Okay? And then the parents come in with the baby because the baby is a citizen. This is like crazy. They used to call it anchor babies but they don't use that term anymore because it doesn't sound nice. Our laws are so crazy. But one by one, we're finding ways. You know, they call them loopholes. A lot of our laws loopholes. Well, I'm finding loopholes to get around the loophole. Okay? (Laughter and applause.) Because our Congress can't act. They can't act. They just can't act. The Democrats in Congress don't want to touch any of it. Visa lottery that's where they put in the names; they put it in a lottery, and you pick, Oh, here's a wonderful person. Wonderful. You know, he killed four people. Here's here's another wonderful. And then they get in and we say, Gee, that person just came into our country. He just robbed a store and killed somebody. How is that possible? Because they send us the people they don't want. The biggest form of subsidy we give to other nations. Immigration systems that prioritize the admission of those who can support themselves financially and contribute. We want people that can help themselves, that can support themselves. We have people coming in. We support them from the day they come in until the day they die. We can't do that as a country. We can't afford to do that as a country. Sadly, on immigration and so many other issues, Democrat lawmakers have totally abandoned the American mainstream. But that's going to be good for us in 2020. They're embracing open borders, socialism, and extreme late-term abortion. Weeks ago, lawmakers in New York cheered as they passed legislation to allow babies to be ripped from the womb of their mother right up to the very moment of death. Then, in an act and a statement, the likes of which I don't think I've ever heard, in Virginia, the governor a Democrat stated that he would allow babies to be born, to be born outside. He would wrap them. He would take care of them. And then he'll talk to the mother and the father as to what to be done. And if they didn't want the child, who is now outside of the womb long outside of the womb they will execute the baby after birth. They will execute the baby after birth. And that's one many people have never even heard of or thought about. This is a radical agenda by the Democrats. And when you put something up, as was just put up before the Senate, everybody on the Democrat side votes for it. By the way, I have to say one thing: They're lousy politicians and they have lousy policy. They have policy I could never sell if I wanted to. But but big but they always stick together. And the Republicans don't remember that. Remember that. They always stick together. They vote in blocs. They have 47. We had a tremendous victory. We were given no credit. I can't go and campaign for all of the people in the House. Too many. And guys like Meadows wins by so many points he doesn't need any help. He doesn't need it. I say, Mark, do you need any help? No, I'm okay. He'll win by 30, 35. They're okay. These guys you know a funny thing? The ones that love Trump, the ones that are really the Trumpers like Meadows, Jordan, Gates, so many of them. I don't want to I could just name so many. They're the ones that win with that. I mean, it's like they don't even have an election. It's the ones that sort of they're a little shy about embracing what we're all about, they get clobbered. They get clobbered. Take a look. Those are the ones that get clobbered. But the good news is they're all starting to find that out. Just this week, Senate Democrats opposed legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children who survive abortions. Virtually every Democrat voted against protecting these precious babies. Every one. They vote in groups. And we did have that great victory. We won for 51. And two that we didn't like got out. They said they retired. They didn't retire. They were retired. They said, These two senators have decided to retire. No, no, no. They retired because they had like very little support. Like how about 5 percent? Any percent. No, we did great. We had 53 we picked up in the Senate. They were going to win the Senate, remember? And I'll tell you, folks, I worked hard. I did 32 big, fat rallies. And those rallies brought us to a tremendous Senate victory so that we can continue onward with our judges and our approvals. And the fake news back there, they love to say Donald Trump suffered a big defeat. First of all, we won the Senate, which, frankly, judges you know, I hate to say it: In all due respect for us, the Senate, far more important. I really worked hard. But think of it. We won the Senate and we had this, like, tremendous victory. We get no credit at all. Wait until you see what happens. They say, Donald Trump suffered a humiliating defeat. I said, I wasn't running. And one of the commentators and I appreciate it one of the shows where they were saying how I suffered a defeat, this commentator said, Excuse me, he didn't run. You know, not all our candidates were exactly great. Let's face it. You know, you can only do so much. But wait until you see what's happening when I do run. And what they don't say is governor of Ohio, great guy. Mike. Mike. Mike was down six. He won by seven with one day. Right? He was down by six. One day into the election, I went out, I campaigned, worked hard, made a speech. Jim Jordan was there. Everybody was there. It was a fantastic crowd like this. Like this. And all the people in the other ballrooms that are waiting for us. And he ended up winning. He was down by six; he won by seven. One day. Then we have Georgia the governor of Georgia. Great guy. Where's Georgia? Great guy. He was losing in the primary by 10. I got a call from David Perdue and Sonny Perdue two great guys. Could you endorse him? I said, Let me check. And I checked him. He was a Trumper before Trump was a Trumper. And I said, I love this guy. He's down by 10. He won by 40. Can you believe that? I endorsed him, Mark. He won by 40. Then he had a tough race against the new star of the Democrat Party not Democratic. It's Democrat. We have to do that. You know, it sounds prettier when we use Democratic. I even like I hate to say in the speech, the Democrat Party because it doesn't sound good. But that's all the more reason I use it, because it doesn't. They should change it because it sounds much better. Rhetorically, it's much better. Much better. But then, he had an election against their star who followed me after the State of the Union Address. I didn't think she was great. But she's their star. And who showed up? Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, and President Obama. And they campaigned for her, and they worked so hard. And all our man had was Trump. And we kicked their ass. True. We had a rally at the airport, where 55,000 people showed up to the airport. It was one hangar. They had three other hangars that were full. They went so far back. The problem was they gave the press, like these guys they gave the press too good a location because the people behind them couldn't see properly. I was so angry. But we had 55,000 people show up. I said, You're going to win the election. He won the election. He won it fairly easily, against their star. And now David Perdue is going to win for senator in 2020. And then and then we had Florida, and many others. And we have a candidate, Ron DeSantis a friend. A friend of many of us in this room. But nobody knew he was running. He was running against, in the primary, somebody that was easily going to win. He was scheduled to be the next governor of Florida. But Ron has been great to me on the witch hunt. He's been a defender of me against these phony charges of Russia. Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. My wife said, You never spoke to anybody from Russia, darling. I said, That's right. But Ron DeSantis I like people that defend me. You know, when people defend me, I defend them. So he came. That's why I like Mark. That's why I like Mark Levin. And I'm not sure a lot of people like him. He's tough as hell. But I like him. I love him. But then we have Florida. So, Ron DeSantis is at three. Three. He calls up, Sir, can I have your endorsement? I said, Ron, you're at three. Your opponent is, I guess, agriculture commissioner has 22 million in the bank. His poll numbers are very good. He's up in the 20s or 30s. I said, Ron, don't make me do this, Ron. Sir, I can win. All right, Ron. Here we go. Because I know if he loses which almost never happens when I endorse somebody. Almost never. Only one time, and that was because it was done in the middle of the day of the election. Nobody knew I did it. They got home, they said, I didn't know Trump endorsed him. But we rarely, rarely lose. But I said, Ron, don't do it. I said, All right, I'll do it. He went from 3 to 60. To 60. And then he ran against a guy who had unbelievable support. He had every celebrity go into Florida. He had money all over the place. And Ron was in there pitching, and I was in there pitching with him. And we now have a great governor in the state of Florida. And I could mention many others other governors, many other states. But I'm not going to bore you with it. And I think I really think that it's incredible what we did in the midterms. I think it's incredible. Governor of Florida. Governor of Ohio. Remember, You can't win unless you win the state of Ohio. We got the governor of Ohio, and he's great. Mike. We love you, Mike. As we defend American values at home, we are also defending. American security abroad. We have secured all sorts of funding, all sorts of record everything. And we will never forget our military. We will never forget our veterans. We are taking care of our veterans like they've never been taken care of before. We just got them Choice, so now they can go see a doctor. Now they can go and see a doctor instead of waiting on line for weeks and weeks and weeks. And we got them Accountability. You couldn't fire anybody in the VA. You had sadists. You had people that took advantage of our veterans. They've hit them. They were sadists. They were sick people. You couldn't fire them. You had thieves that were stealing openly stealing. You couldn't fire them. I got a bill passed: VA Accountability. Now you look at the guy, you say, Get the hell out of here. You're fired. Get out. Nobody thought we could get it. For 40 years they tried to get it. For 40 years they tried to get it; they couldn't get it. And VA Choice, they thought for many, many decades they'd been trying to get VA Choice. You couldn't get it. Now, instead of waiting on line for two days, nine days, three weeks people were dying. People that weren't very sick would be dead by the time they saw a doctor, six weeks later. Now these great veterans, if there's a big wait, they go outside, they go to a local doctor. We pay the bills. They get better. Everybody is happy. And we actually save a lot of money, if you can believe it. And I got that approved after 44 years of being unable to get it approved for our veterans. We love our veterans. And just in finishing up, as you know, I just returned from Vietnam, where I had very productive meetings with Chairman Kim Jong Un. Very productive. We get along. We've developed a good relationship very good and made great historic progress. And I do get a kick out of all these people in previous administrations: Donald Trump should not, under any circumstances, be doing this or that. You know, they're telling me how to negotiate. These guys died. One administration gave billions of dollars to him and got nothing. And we haven't given him anything yet. I look forward to maybe doing something at some point. But I know one thing: I'm going to get other countries to give. Maybe not us, but I'm going to get other countries to give, and if it all works out. If it all works out. But I had to walk. Because every once in a while, you have to walk, because the deal wasn't a deal that was acceptable to me. I don't like these deals that politicians make. They make a deal just for the sake of doing it. I don't want to do that. I want to make a deal that either works, or let's not make it. But the one thing we have, though, is we have no testing, no missiles going up, no rockets going up. No nuclear testing. We got our great people back. We get our great, great people. And that includes our beautiful, beautiful Otto Otto Warmbier whose parents I've gotten to know, who's incredible. And I'm in such a horrible position, because in one way I have to negotiate. In the other way, I love Mr. and Mrs. Warmbier, and I love Otto. And it's a very, very delicate balance. He was a special young man. And to see what happened was so bad. It was so bad. And a lot of what I do with respect to North Korea, and any success that we hopefully have and we've had a lot. We're given no credit. They don't remember that, in the last days of the Obama administration, rockets were flying all over the place, nuclear testing was going on. Mountains were being these are big mountains. They were being shoved over three, four inches. People thought it was massive earthquakes, then they found out, no, that was nuclear weapons nuclear testing. So much. We're getting the remains back of a lot of our soldiers from many, many years ago. Mike Pence was in Hawaii. It was one of the most beautiful ceremonies. We've made a lot of progress, and we'll continue to make progress. And I really think what we're doing there is very important. But we actually had to walk, but I think we had a very good meeting. In fact, when I came home, they put out a statement that, actually, they were willing to do much less on the sanction front. But you see, that's not what happened there. So already, I think we're negotiating. And I'll tell you this: North Korea has an incredible, brilliant economic future, if they make a deal. But they don't have any economic future if they have nuclear weapons. It's really a bad thing for them. So we'll see how it all goes. But I think it's going well. I think we learned a lot over the last couple of days. And again, the relationship seems to be very, very strong. And that's an important thing, especially when we're dealing with this kind of a situation. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America. You saw that. Would you like to apologize? No. I'm not apologizing. Now you have a President who is standing up for America. After decades of building up foreign nations, we are finally building up our nation, and we are doing it with American hands, American grit, and with beautiful, beautiful American steel. We are fighting to ensure that every young American inherits the same blessings and the same boundless opportunity that our ancestors fought to secure with all of their heart, might, and soul. Now more than ever, we need the proud men and women of CPAC. And I want to thank everybody here, because it is incredible. Your organization is incredible. Matt and Mercedes, incredible. You're energized, you're mobilized, and you're engaged. We need your voice. We need your patriotism. We need your commitment. We need your incredible spirit on the Fourth of July. We are having, in Washington, D.C., a great tribute to America. I hope you can all come. Fourth of July keep it open. We want to bring millions of people into the city, and we want people to come who love our country. Those are the people we want. The Fourth of July. A salute to America. Now is the time to embrace the promise of our history. Now is the time to defend our American legacy. And now is the time to seize our glorious destiny. And, by the way, I'm watching those doors. Not one person has left, and I've been up here a long time. I said, Matt, is that okay? He said, I love it. Don't leave. But not one person. So if you hear tomorrow, when they read people left nobody left early. There hasn't been one person that's left. But when you read it, you just say fake news. This magnificent nation will always be the home of those who cherish life, who love liberty, and who defend the sacred rights given to us by Almighty God. Together, we are one people, one family, and one nation, forever united behind one great American flag. Thank you to everybody in this room and to all of the other rooms, all over the campus and all over the country. We're hooked in all over the country. Thank you very much. What a job they've done. What a job Matt Schlapp and his family have done in such a short period of time, in bringing this to a level like it's never been before.`;
